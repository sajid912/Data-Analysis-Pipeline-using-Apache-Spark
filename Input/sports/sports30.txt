Here’s how.There’s a familiar refrain heard in living rooms around the world during the Olympic Games: “I could do that.” Eye rolls usually follow. But if you are watching the Games and wondering if you can follow in the footsteps of those athletes, here’s a way to get started.First, you’ll have to check your ego at the door. You most likely will not be able to nail a chicken salad grab (yes, that’s really what it’s called) on the halfpipe or do a double full twist as an aerial ski jumper. With a humble approach, you can start chasing down your own Olympic, or recreational, dreams. Don’t quite fit into that age demographic? There are luge tracks and clinics open to all ages.But don’t expect to go too fast, or be able to progress too quickly. At the highest level, athletes move at 85 miles per hour. It takes a lot of training to get to that speed and precision safely. Want the exhilaration of a sliding sport without any of the training or danger? That’s an option too. Many sliding centers offer visitors the opportunity to ride in a bobsled with a pilot. Adrenaline junkies rejoice. Halfpipe snowboarding, slopestyle skiing and aerials have all gained notoriety as some of the flashier sports at the Games, but no one is born able to do those brilliant flying acrobatics. Looking as graceful as the world’s best speedskaters takes time. But if you are an experienced in-line skater, you already have a head start. Erin Jackson, a United States Olympian, transitioned from in-line skating to speedskating just months before qualifying for the Pyeongchang Games. Want to slow down a bit? Try curling.
