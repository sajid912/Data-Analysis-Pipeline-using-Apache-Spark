Division I men’s basketball tournament (estimated wagers this year: more than $10 billion).But maybe that’s just me, what with the many bracket pools I’m invited to join every spring and the associated entry fees I’m asked to payment-app-as-verb to various gambling enablers — I mean pool organizers — around the country.My particular challenges aside, this year’s iteration of March Madness and the Final Four is yet another reminder of America’s long-simmering and complex relationship with sports betting.That none of these developments has rallied much outcry or opposition reflects both an evolution and devolution of attitudes toward the subject.Credit, too, the escalation of athletes’ salaries, which makes the reward of taking bribes to throw games rarely worth the risk of getting caught. (It’s no coincidence that tennis and lower-tier soccer — whose competitors often earn little enough to be vulnerable — continue to struggle most with match fixing.)Gambling does not represent any kind of new threat to American sports. On the contrary, it’s a homecoming of sorts to sports’ roots.There’s no record of it, but it’s almost a certainty that as soon as the first pair of crook-wielding Scottish shepherds decided to see who could knock dried sheep dung closest to a rabbit hole — golf! — so, too, did a couple of nearby highland lads agree to wager on the outcome. Ancient Olympics, scholars believe, had betting scandals, involving bribetaking athletes throwing a wrestling match or foot race.More relevant and recent is the close connection between betting and two of the world’s oldest and most popular organized sports, cricket and baseball — both, it should be noted, invented in England.Betting was so integral to cricket’s modern provenance that the first rules books were concerned almost entirely with the adjudication of betting disagreements. Likewise, the earliest newspaper accounts of cricket matches focused a little on runs tallied and a lot on amounts wagered. Landed gentry and other moneyed types were especially fond of the new hobby.Baseball, one of the earliest known references to which (“base-ball”) shows up in a 1744 English publication, “A Little Pretty Pocket Book,” also began as child’s play but flowered as an adult activity. But America’s “national pastime,” which started evolving almost as soon as play began in North America, retained at least one strand of British sporting DNA: Yanks loved to gamble on it — and not just on the outcome of games.So fast were bets laid and so furiously did money change hands that serious gamblers congregated near the field, in sections referred to as “pool boxes.” Their coarse banter and unseemly behavior — imagine a stock trading pit, but with chewing tobacco and whiskey — forced many of the game’s organizers, who were interested in drawing families and other wholesome spectators, to shut down the pool boxes.This did nothing to curtail betting because the pool boxes simply reset nearby, in saloons and billiards halls, using runners to bring news back from the diamond.In fact, so closely did betting pools and pool boxes become associated with billiards that when sports-bar patrons took a break from this March’s madness, some doubtless turned away from the bank of TVs, picked up a cue stick and challenged someone to a game Americans long ago stopped referring to as billiards and started, for obvious reasons, calling pool.As for this spring’s pools, expect a frenzy of digital transactions once the 2018 tourney champ is crowned and winnings are distributed. Just don’t expect any money to wind up in my Venmo account.
