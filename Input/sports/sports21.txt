AdvertisementSupported byUnited States prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas in a far-reaching investigation of international sports corruption, seeking new information about some of the biggest sports organizations in the world — including FIFA, the International Olympic Committee and the United States Olympic Committee — as well as the people who have successfully lobbied to host top global competitions.The Justice Department is exploring possible racketeering, money laundering and fraud charges related to two track and field world championship events and the business executives who have consulted on bids for various other elite competitions, according to one of the subpoenas, which was obtained by The New York Times.The subpoenas, delivered in January, have solicited documents, testimony and financial records dating to 2013. Since that time, the United States has won bids to host two major sports events: the 2021 track and field world championships, in Eugene, Ore., and the 2028 Summer Olympics, in Los Angeles. The subpoena did not explicitly refer to the Los Angeles Olympic bid.Of particular interest to the Justice Department, according to the subpoena, is the world governing body for track and field, known as the International Association of Athletics Federations. That federation awarded the sport’s 2019 world championships to Doha, Qatar, and the 2021 event to Eugene.A spokesman for the Eastern District declined to comment on Wednesday.The individuals summoned to provide information, including personal and corporate bank records, were asked to appear in federal court in Brooklyn as soon as this week.The government’s request came just as global sports officials prepared to travel to Pyeongchang, South Korea, for the Winter Olympics, and as the United States Olympic Committee has been roiled by the case of Lawrence G. Nassar, a former doctor for the American gymnastics team convicted of sexually abusing scores of young athletes.A spokesman for the U.S.O.C. declined to comment on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for the world governing body of track and field said the organization had not been contacted by American investigators. “We stand ready to cooperate, if they do,” she said.The International Olympic Committee, too, had not been contacted, a spokesman for the organization said, minimizing the organization’s relevance to any potential inquiry. Prosecutors have broadly requested emails, text messages, notes and contracts relating to the I.O.C. over the last five years; the same is true for the other organizations.Among the specific sports marketing companies that prosecutors are scrutinizing, according to the subpoena, is Helios Partners, a firm that has lobbied global sports officials to award high-profile events to particular cities and countries. Helios helped Russia secure the 2014 Winter Olympics and the coming 2018 World Cup, before its acquisition in 2012 by the Amaury Group, a French media company.American prosecutors are also specifically interested in Eugene’s successful bid for the track and field event, which the U.S.O.C. actively supported, and Doha’s successful effort to host the 2019 edition of that competition, which occurs every two years.Lamine Diack, who ran the international track federation for 16 years and served as a longtime member of the I.O.C., has been detained in France since November 2015, accused of accepting bribes for covering up the doping violations of Russian athletes.FIFA itself has sought to turn the page on its corruption scandal, emphasizing its status as a victim in the American case and its cooperation with investigators. Former officials were charged with an array of crimes, including racketeering conspiracy and fraud — the same issues central to the prosecutors’ continuing scrutiny.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
