The Mexican presidential hopeful Ricardo Anaya wants to help the United States build a wall on the Rio Grande. And the campaign of his leftist rival Andrés Manuel López Obrador is being organized out of authoritarian Venezuela. Meanwhile, Mexico’s first lady, Angélica Rivera, has called Mr. López Obrador a “pobreton,” or pauper.All of those stories are totally false.This flurry of misinformation illustrates the ways in which, in the age of social media, fake news has become a global problem that can affect any political election in any country on the planet.So far, it is hard to discern whether the sea of misinformation is having a significant impact on the Mexican race — or whether dark forces have aligned to support a particular candidate, as they appeared to in the United States presidential election. The fake news could be coming from several angles.Whatever the impact on polls, the spread of lies stains public debate and causes stress and confusion. A recent false message circulating on the messaging service WhatsApp said public health clinics had run out of medicine. Another fake story claimed that certain people won’t be allowed to vote, so they shouldn’t bother turning out.“These efforts are doing a good job of showing people what is fake and what is real, which gives some hope,” said the journalist Esteban Illades, author of a book about the spread of fake news. “But we also need to educate people about news and the media from a young age. We need to undertake a major social effort.”A result is distrust in the government and the news media, while many Mexicans choose to believe what their emotions tell them. In such conditions, it is less that Mexico is entering a post-truth era as it is staying stuck in one. Fake news is yet another obstacle in the way of the many here who are struggling to build an honest and open society.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
