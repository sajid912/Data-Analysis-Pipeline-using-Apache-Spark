He said all such legislation should do the following, at minimum: monitor betting to prevent “improper conduct” and unusual betting activity; impose a 1 percent fee on the total amount of bets, to be paid to sports leagues; allow leagues to restrict certain types of wagering on their events; contain consumer protection requirements; and authorize betting on digital platforms, not solely “land-based casinos.”Correction: January 25, 2018An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the N.B.A.’s position in New Jersey’s lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Paspa. The N.B.A. is a plaintiff, not a defendant.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
