As complex human beings with ever-changing desires, we may not fit so neatly into click-and-consent existence portrayed in that “Black Mirror” episode, or envisioned by the app developers. But they are making steps toward addressing a problem that needs solving.Use of the app “has to be planned,” she said, “and it’s really difficult for us to even know how we feel in the present moment, much less trying to anticipate how we might feel an hour from now.”Mr. Schmitz said that a LegalFling agreement does not override someone changing his or her mind in the moment or being too intoxicated, for example, to consent. The company suggests you withdraw consent via the app at that moment, but, of course, that’s not always possible.If encounters leave users feeling violated, Mr. Schmitz said, they should notify the aggressor afterward in a message, and it will be added to the record.Also possible with a tap: triggering cease-and-desist letters, according to the website.“It would be very awkward within the context of an intimate encounter to be like, ‘Wait a second, I’m changing my mind on the app and also with you,’” she said.More important, she said, the app could persuade someone to fulfill acts simply because they agreed to them in advance, or to overcommit in an effort to appear more sexually adventurous.These digital agreements could certainly be used as evidence of, at the time the button was pushed, what an individual’s intent or desires were, according to Mr. Cherkasky. “We already see it all the time in social media or text messages,” he said, adding that they would most likely be legally viable in cases globally, as well.But these agreements do have the potential to be used as a means of protection to an aggressor, he said, especially by a violent and premeditating criminal. It’s very common in domestic violence cases for an attacker to have a “great deal of power over the person and force them to do a number of things,” he said.Even implying that someone doesn’t have the right to change their mind is a real risk, he said. Though the risk also exists for an accused person, who may have fully gotten consent in the moment even if “the box wasn’t checked.”“It turns consent into a joke, a technicality that people think is black and white or can be recorded in a moment of time,” he said.But technology is reflecting a cultural shift in respecting and understanding the idea of consent, he said.Dr. Drouin agreed: People are now communicating about these incidents in ways that are recordable and admissible in court, she said. “It’s no longer ‘he said, she said.’”We-Consent records a short video of two people stating their affirmative consent, according to the company, and uses facial recognition technology. That recording is encrypted and inaccessible without a legal petition.There are over 100,000 encrypted files, Mr. Lissack said, but the institute has had only two requests ever to retrieve the videos. In both instances — before We-Consent turned in the videos — the fact that they were available spurred the cases to settle, Mr. Lissack said.“From Day 1, the purpose of the app was to get people who are about do something to discuss what they’re going to do with one another,” he said.Consent can happen only from discussion, he said, “not from sending emoji back and forth, nodding your head or signing some weird legal agreement.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
