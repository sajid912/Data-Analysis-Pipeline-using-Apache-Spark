AdvertisementSupported byDear readers,In the first trial, the jury questioned why all these victims hadn’t spoken up sooner.In the first trial, the jury deliberated for six days — and remained deadlocked. And Bill Cosby, the once-beloved comedian charged with drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, remained free.Now Mr. Cosby, 80, faces up to 30 years in prison.Because in the retrial, the jury heard from five women beyond Ms. Constand who testified about having been abused by Mr. Cosby, not just one (those incidents happened too long ago to be prosecuted).In this trial, the verdict came on the second day of deliberations.I’m thinking about that and more this week. Read on for what I’m reading, musing and raging about, as well as a couple of LOLs.Have a good weekend,Jessica________________AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
