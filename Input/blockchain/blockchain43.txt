We tried.For 36 hours last week I lived on Bitcoin alone. Surviving on the cryptocurrency, even in one of the world’s financial capitals, wasn’t easy. It required long subway rides to far-flung vendors where I was often the first Bitcoin-paying customer.Coinbase also canceled my first attempt to buy the volatile currency because the price had fluctuated in the 10 seconds or so it took me to check out.I went to bed and woke up with Bitcoin worth $50.14 in my digital wallet and a list of things to accomplish: grocery shop, do laundry, buy socks, work out and get a haircut.But first, I needed coffee.After pulling a shot of cold brew for 0.00014486 BTC, or $1, the barista called up a QR code on an iPad. I scanned it with an app on my phone, but it didn’t work. He began coaching me like a child patiently setting up Grandpa’s Facebook account, and then gave up.But eventually I figured it out, the payment went through and I became his third Bitcoin-paying customer of the day.Paying with cryptocurrency was like that: exciting, fraught and never the same twice.And like an obsessive day trader, I would check my digital wallet and watch as the value went up and down by a few cents every few minutes.It was fun, until I got hungry.Circa 2013, he said, he’d process dozens of Bitcoin purchases a week, but as the currency became more valuable and volatile, that’s dropped to zero. “People don’t want to part with their Bitcoin,” he said.I couldn’t find anyone to sell me less than $200 worth of socks or a gym that accepted Bitcoin. By the time lunch rolled around on Day 2, I was ready to throw in the towel.Here’s what else is happening:We’d pay a pretty penny for better weather.We could see two inches of rain, and thunder may rumble through the morning.They were the only survivors of the Titanic, which had sunk on April 15, claiming over 1,500 lives.The Titanic left its mark on other places in the city as well.videoAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
