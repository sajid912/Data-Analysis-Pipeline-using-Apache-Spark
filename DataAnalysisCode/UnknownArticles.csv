AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftI dont need to tell you that something is wrong with social mediaThe primary problem with todays social networks is that theyre already too big and are trapped inside a marketbased system that forces them to keep growing Facebook cant stop monetizing our personal data for the same reason that Starbucks cant stop selling coffee  its the heart of the enterpriseMany of the fixes being proposed involve regulation The Honest Ads Act a bill in the Senate would require greater transparency for online political ads The European Unions General Data Protection Regulation which goes into effect in May aims to give users greater control of their digital information trailsIf were really serious about changing how social networks operate far more radical interventions are required Here are three possible ways to rescue social media from the marketbased pressures that got us hereFacebook they write is an example of a new power institution that serves old power interests It harvests the creative output of billions of people and turns it into a giant centralized enterprise with most users sharing none of the economic value they create and getting no say in the platforms governanceInstead the authors ask what if a social network was truly run by its usersIf youre contributing economic value to something of this much social consequence you should share in the value youre creating Mr Heimans told meHe could show that he takes democracy seriously enough to start with his own baby Mr Schneider saidAnother radical approach would be to make social networks work more like email  so that independent apps could seamlessly work together with one another across a common protocolInstead of one big Facebook a federated social network would look like clusters of independent nodes  Mombook and Athletebook and Gamerbook  all of which could be plugged into the umbrella network when it made sense Rather than requiring a onesizefitsall set of policies that apply to billions of users these nodes could be designed to reflect users priorities A network for privacy hawks and one for opensharing maximalists could have different dataretention rules and a network for LGBT users and one for evangelical pastors could have different hate speech rules If a node became too toxic it could be removed without shutting down the entire networkEmail is the most resilient social network on the internet Mr Schneider said and the thing that allows it to adapt is that its an open protocol and people build apps on top of it and we evolve how we use itNone of this is a panacea But experimenting with more decentralized models could give social media users a sense that platforms represented their interests rather than those of a faceless corporationA single friend of mine once remarked that the major difference among dating apps like OKCupid Tinder and Bumble wasnt the way they were designed or the companies behind them  it was how long they had existedNew apps she said were more likely to attract interesting and smart people who were actually looking for dates Older apps by contrast were eventually overrun with creeps and predators no matter how well built they wereA similar theory might apply to social networks Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram and Snapchat all had plenty of issues in their early years but they were by and large cleaner with fewer types of exploitation and malicious behavior Today the enormous size and influence of these platforms have made them irresistible honey pots for bad actors and many of our social graphs  Facebooks term for the webs of digital connections we create  are clogged with years worth of clutterId go even further and suggest that social networks give their users an automatic selfcleaning option which would regularly clear their profiles of apps they no longer used friendships and followers they no longer interacted with and data they no longer needed to store If these tools were enabled users would need to take affirmative action if they didnt want their information to disappear after a certain number of months or yearsMaking social graphs temporary rather than preserving them forever by default would undoubtedly be bad for most social networks business models But it could create new and healthy norms around privacy and data hygiene and it would keep problems from piling up as networks get older and more crowded It might even recapture some of the magic of the original social networks when things were fresh and fascinating and not quite so scaryAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,blockchain

AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE  Seattles latest tax proposal to combat homelessness takes aim at large businesses such as Amazon that have helped drive the citys economic boomBut the measure has sparked intense debate  even shouting matches in otherwise reserved Seattle  over who should pay to solve the housing crisis exacerbated by that growthThe City Council is proposing a tax on employee hours to raise about 75 million a year for affordable housing and homelessness services Nearly 600 large employers making at least 20 million in gross revenues would pay about 500 a year per workerAmazon the citys largest employer would take the biggest hitSupporters insist the online retailer and others that have benefited from Seattles prosperity and contributed to growing income inequality and skyrocketing rents can and should payBusinesses and others say the socalled head tax is misguided and potentially harmful They question whether the city is effectively using the tens of millions of dollars it already spends on homelessness each yearAmazon raised the stakes last week when it halted construction planning on a 17story tower near its hometown headquarters as it awaits a tax vote It is also rethinking filling office space in another leased buildingThe company has more than 45000 workers meaning it would pay more than 20 million a year under the tax It would likely owe even more when the tax switches to a 07 percent tax on business payroll in 2021Councilwoman Kshama Sawant a socialist said affordable housing is critically important and the council should stand up to Amazon and Jeff Bezos bullying Construction workers chanted no head tax and disrupted a news conference she held last week on Amazons campusSeattle Mayor Jenny Durkan hasnt taken a position on the tax but said shell work to find common groundThe proposals four sponsors said in a joint statement last week that the tax doesnt target one company though they noted Amazons record quarterly profitsIt seems only fair that as so many struggle to make their way through a tax system thats rigged in favor of large corporations that we ask those same corporations to financially contribute to the public health and housing solutions designed to address those consequences they wroteA council committee could vote this week and the full council may take it up MondayAmazons threat to pause its expansion in Seattle comes as 20 cities vie to lure the companys second headquarters and as it expands its workforce in Boston and Vancouver British Columbia Some see it as a warning to those contendersBut Jeff Shulman an associate professor in the University of Washingtons Foster School of Business said he thinks Amazon is more focused on the long termThe city is looking at how much Amazon makes and comparing whatever tax to that number and that could be a scary thought to Amazon he said adding The 20 million could be viewed as a start and if Amazon doesnt show it will react now it can be the start of a slippery slopeProponents say people are dying on the streets and while cityfunded programs found homes for 3400 people last year the problem deepens The Seattle region had the thirdhighest number of homeless people in the US and saw 169 homeless deaths in 2017Most money raised would build 1780 affordable housing units over five years Onefifth would go toward shelter beds tiny homes hygiene garbage cleanup and other homeless servicesSince 1986 Seattle voters have agreed five separate times to tax themselves to pay for affordable housing Most recently they approved a 290 million levy in 2016Its painful and its embarrassing that we live in a city with so much financial prosperity and so many people without shelter Lloyd David executive director of the Polyclinic a multispecialty medical clinic told the council at a boisterous City Hall hearing where the council committee chairwoman admonished the chanting crowd and cleared the room at one pointBut David said his clinic has a profit margin of less than 1 percent and would have had an operating loss of almost 500000 if the tax was in effect this yearTom Campanile CEO of The Essential Baking Company said the tax would cost his business 250000 on top of the 250000 in business taxes and 40000 in property taxes it already pays He said his margins are slim and he cant pass costs on to grocery stores and other customersTheyre getting taxed and Im getting taxed How much are people willing to pay for local bread Its going to be more expensive to operate in Seattle he said in an interviewWhile criticized for being slow to contribute Amazon in recent years donated two buildings on its campus to house the homeless It also plans to build a shelter for homeless women children and families within one of its new buildingsTensions also boiled over at a recent town hall at a church Some residents clapped while others jeered and booed when Councilman Mike OBrien told the crowd We designed a tax that we believe is fairAll companies that do well and want to partner with our city should have a place here to be prosperous but that prosperity needs to be shared he addedSome residents demanded more accountability and shouted their frustration over what they see is the citys failure to address crime drug use camping on sidewalks and in parks and other problems associated with unauthorized homeless encampmentsNobody wants to see people living on the streets But come up with a viable option said Jennifer Schuyler opponent of the tax And what are you going to do with the money Show us a

former sports medicine doctor across a courtroom on FridayThe man Randall Margraves had been standing next to his daughters Lauren and Madison in Eaton County Circuit Court in Charlotte Mich as they gave statements about Dr Nassars sexual abuse When they were finished he asked Judge Janice K Cunningham if she would give him five minutes in a locked room with Dr Nassar When she said no he asked for one minuteAs she was speaking saying that he knew she could not do that Mr Margraves then rushed across the room toward Dr Nassar who was seated at a table on his left toward the front of the courtroom Law enforcement officials wrestled Mr Margraves down to the ground handcuffed him and led him outWhat if this happened to you guys he told the deputies handcuffing himIt was not clear whether Dr Nassar was injuredThe hearing resumed several minutes laterI cant imagine what it is like for a parent the judge said as the hearing resumed after Mr Margraves was led out In addition to the Eaton County hearing another of his daughters Morgan had provided a victim impact statement about Dr Nassars abuse at an Ingham County Circuit Court hearing which ended last weekJudge Cunningham said Dr Nassars sentence would consume his natural life We cannot react by using physical violence and assault against someone who is and has performed criminal acts That is not how our system worksLets get back to the business of why we are here she saidDr Nassar sat with his head down listeningAfter he was removed from the courtroom Mr Margraves was placed in detention for possible contempt of court but the judge later released him without charge Jerri Nesbitt the executive assistant of Eaton County Sheriff Thomas Reich said by telephoneCalls to several members of Mr Margravess family were not returned on FridayThe hearing is based on a guilty plea by Dr Nassar the former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University sports medicine doctor in November to three counts of criminal sexual conduct two of them against girls between the ages of 13 and 15 and one against a girl younger than 13 according to the plea dealJudge Cunningham said before Fridays hearing started that she met with the lawyers on his team to address the remarksHe has disavowed those statements she said adding they were not relevant to the sentencing hearingWhat is relevant she added is for the court to hear each individual story and how his actions affected their livesThe plea agreement said the abuse occurred between September 2009 and September 2011 A sentencing memorandum said the abuse had taken place at Twistars Gymnastics Club near Lansing Mich whose owner and coach John Geddert rose to prominence as an Olympics coach in 2012More than 65 young women and teenagers were scheduled to give victim impact statements during the sentencing hearing which started on Wednesday and resumed on Friday after a oneday break Judge Cunningham said the number of victims who had come forward was up to 265 some of whom chose to remain anonymousAbout 30 have shared statements as of Friday morning and Dr Nassar will be sentenced after all the victims speak The plea agreement states the minimum sentencing range would be 25 to 40 years for each of the countsMany of the young women and teenagers who spoke in the two courtrooms have told stories that have similar elements including their abuse by a doctor they were referred to or instructed to see by coaches Some said that nothing was done after they finally did come forward to report multiple incidents of the abuse which stretches back decadesI was truly looking forward to trying to turn this program around and bring success to our country and the gymnastics community he said in a statement But the present climate causes me and more importantly my family far too much stress difficulty and uncertaintyMSU is also under investigation by the NCAA and the state attorney generalOn Thursday the Meridian Township Mich police chief Dave Hall apologized to a young woman Brianne RandallGay for not seeking an outside opinion when she reported sexual abuse in 2004 by Dr Nassar who then defended himself to the police by presenting a stack of medical documents during the investigationMs RandallGay was 17 at the time that she sought Dr Nassars help for her backChief Hall speaking in a news conference said that Ms RandallGay would help with training and community outreach to help youth understand how to report criminal sexual conduct to the authoritiesI was disappointed there were no charges filed Ms RandallGay said referring to the decision by the police to not pursue the investigation further after she first reported the abuse I felt like I was ignoredHe has also been sentenced to between 40 to 175 years in the Ingham County

he attends games he prefers to stand rather than sit At home in Boston he turns on televisions in five rooms and paces between themFor that one moment on Tuesday as the final whistle blew on Romas 30 defeat of Barcelona the culmination of one of the greatest comebacks one of the greatest shocks in Champions League history he simply stopped and watchedIn the stands 56000 Roma fans were hugging bouncing singing and celebrating Romas charge from a 41 deficit after last weeks first leg against what was shaping up to be one of the great teams in Barcelona historyThousands of people crying their eyes out Pallotta said in a telephone interview on ThursdayOn the field the players and the coaching staff were racing ricocheting around In the directors box the clubs executives veered between ecstasy and astonishment Only the president took a step back and soaked it all inI have never seen anything like it Pallotta said People just going bananasHe did not leave the Stadio Olimpico for some time that night There were news media interviews to do guests to greet each of them passing on breathless congratulations He went to the locker room to celebrate with his players and his coach Eusebio Di FrancescoIt was deep into the small hours of Wednesday morning when he arrived back at the steps of his hotel the Hotel de Russie around the corner from Piazza del Popolo He has stayed there on every visit to Rome since he took control of the club in 2012 When he returned the Roma fans among the staff were decked out in the clubs colors  yellow and a red verging on burnt orange  to welcome himOne of them Alessandro told me that there were thousands of people on the piazza Pallotta said He said You go you go  Pallotta obeyed On the way a member of his coterie suggested he should jump in the fountain that sits in the center of the square Pallotta 60 thought it sounded like a great ideaHe took off his jacket and removed his cellphone and credit cards from his pockets This it turns out was not his first rodeo He strolled up to the fountain sat on its lip and tumbled in And then I thought Lets get something to eat he saidIt was only later in his hotel room that it occurred to him that Romes authorities do not take kindly to people jumping in its fountains On Wednesday he apologized to the citys mayor and accepted his 280 fine He also pledged 280000 to help restore another fountain in front of the PantheonI do not condone people jumping in fountains he said But if you do you should pay to fix themTuesday night was that kind of night in Rome Roma had not reached the last four of the European Cup since 1984 and few had given the team a hope against mighty Barcelona against Lionel Messi and Luis Surez and the rest When the draw was made all of the Spanish newspapers said it was easy Pallotta said One of the headlines was Roman Candy By the time he had eaten dried off and gone to bed he could still hear gleeful fans singing in the streets It was the sort of night in other words when the billionaire American owner of an Italian soccer team jumping into a fountain felt like a great ideaIf Pallottas celebration was exuberant though the work that made it possible was significantly coolerheaded Since taking control almost six years ago  he first invested in Roma in a minority passive role in 2008  Pallotta has done all he can to turn what was once a debtridden chaotic club into a sleek sophisticated outfitIt seems a strange gauge but Romas approach to social media and its business endeavors offer an insight into Pallottas visionFunny as those films were the strategy was significant Pallotta like many American owners in soccer sees his team as a content company The premium content of course is the sport itself but that is just one element If you want to be a worldwide brand you have to create content 247 he saidPallotta now believes Roma creates more content than most of its peers Its website was named Best in Class at last years Interactive Media Awards It is Pallotta said one of the fastest growing teams in social and digital media Roma is starting to rival clubs of far greater resources and historical scopeThat is not the only advancement Roma has recruited specialists in ticketing marketing and branding a quiet revolution in the staid conservative world of Italian soccer Pallotta hopes to break ground on a new stadium after considerable delays in December it will be an entertainment and retail venue and he believes it will be one of the mostused facilities in EuropeRoma is also investigating machinelearning to try to refine its scouting processes Pallotta hired a Canadian statistician Luke Bornn as head of data analytics and software then replaced him last year with a Scot Stephen McCarthyThe work is still in its comparative infancy but proved crucial in Pallottas greatest coup tempting Monchi the longtime sporting director of the Spanish side Sevilla and widely regarded as a man with a golden touch in the transfer market to Rome last year Monchi Pallotta explained had pursued in Seville a version of what Roma was tryingMonchi was impressed when he saw what Pallottas data scientists were doing at their Boston war room He saw that we could take what he was thinking and bring it to fruition said Pallotta who is confident that Romas analytics work is more sophisticated than that of 99 percent of its peersThere is here a parallel with one of the three teams that Roma might face in the Champions League semifinals Pallotta has known John W Henry and Tom Werner of Fenway Sports Group owner of Liverpool for years Henry whose own team knocked off Manchester City on Tuesday called Pallotta to offer congratulations after Romas defeat of Barcelona I missed the call Pallotta said I think I was in the fountainFSG has spent much of its tenure aware that it cannot outspend clubs backed by vast commercial revenues oligarchs or sovereign wealth funds just as Roma cannot hope to compete financially with Juventus at least while the new stadium remains mired in red tapeThough it has taken several missteps FSG too has discovered that it has to be smarter than its rivals if it cannot be richer It has adopted a datadriven recruitment strategy revamped its commercial team and found new ways of monetizing its passionate support Manager Jurgen Klopp hired in 2015 has helped plenty tooThe reward for both is a place in the final four of the worlds most prestigious club competition Both would of course reject the assertion that they were punching above their weight  Liverpool has won the European Cup five times  but in financial terms both remain underdogs when compared with their prospective opponents Real Madrid and Bayern Munich and their recent victims Manchester City and BarcelonaThat they are both here within touching distance of a final of glory is vindication for all they have done it also offers hope to others that the latter stages of the Champions League are not

AdvertisementSupported byNew York StorySports fandom is an addiction it doesnt go away in midwinter when your seasonal teams are dreadful March Madness is well in March pitchers and catchers are still working out in high school gyms and the Westminster Dog Show is a fastapproaching headline Today if youre a New York fan particularly with the Knicks Nets Rangers Devils and Islanders all wallowing in the kind of meh play that drains the juice out of both hope and despair and particularly on Super Bowl Sunday with our football franchises in a catastrophic state of haplessness youre fundamentally lostOK there is the powerful Yankee lineup to look forward to with its promise to rocket countless baseballs into the stratosphere But opening day is a distant horizon and weve been dreaming that dream for weeks now since Aaron Judge and his 52 homers almost carried them to the pennant and then Giancarlo Stanton with 59 of his own came aboard in a December trade An addiction needs to be fed more regularly than thatSo the really hardcore fan  by which I mean someone like me who is so pathetically hooked on local sports news that the hiring of a new defensive coordinator has an effect on my day  might find himself in deep consideration of whether the Jets should take another chance on an equalparts talent and pain in the neck like the pouty stubborn defensive end Muhammad Wilkerson Probably not Or as I confess to doing arguing in the comments section of Giantscom that Eli Manning still has a couple of years left in him so the new general manager ought to forget about drafting one of those toutedbutflawed West Coast quarterbacks and take the running back from Penn State insteadThere is of course a football game this weekend And as foul luck would have it New York footballs two most loathsome rivals are contending for the championship Im going to avoid naming them for as long as I can especially the team that always seems to be there  eight out of the 16 times the game has been played in February which is every year except one since 2002 My friend Felicia who lives in Maine deep in Red Sox nation and has her other favorite local team playing in the game offers a semiconsolation Derek Jeter finally retired Someday Tom Brady will tooAnyway speaking of February theres something ironic in holding what is allegedly the most important American sports event of the year this month The first couple of weeks of February were for decades acknowledged as the true doldrums of the sports year a miserable desert of irrelevant college basketball games and midseason yawners from the NBA and the NHL But not to be outdone a mere three months after a World Series game was first played in November the NFL stretching its schedule out like a cat waking up from a nap plunked the Super Bowl down in February Great right A big sporting occasion where none ever was before a steppingstone in the previously unfordable chasm between the Australian Open and spring trainingExcept not really no largely because at the same time the Super Bowl inflated to become not so much a ballgame as a happening like the Oscars but with concussions And anyway if you dont live within a threehour drive of Cape Cod your team hardly ever gets there Actually New York fans have been rewarded more than most  the Jets actually triumphed in their single Super Bowl appearance now a yellowed memory Ah 1969 Broadway Joe Namath and the Giants have made it five times winning four  including two against the team that makes me spit in 2008 a victory propelled by the famous helmet catch by an otherwise forgotten receiver David Tyree and 2012 featuring for my money an even more miraculous catch by another forgotten receiver Mario ManninghamBut in any case unless your local team is one of the lucky annual pair the competition on the field takes a back seat to the endless pregame blah blah blah the halftime extravaganza the rollout of new advertisements at a cost that might otherwise stabilize Social Security and the betting line in Vegas where gamblers risk enough to underwrite a singlepayer health care system Im old enough to have watched with interest the first Super Bowl which was no contest and no big deal Sundays is the 52nd or Super Bowl LII as befits the silly grandiosity of it all Justin Timberlake ReallyThis year especially there was much to feel sour about The Colin Kaepernick national anthem protest stirred up dueling camps of outrage  and a presidential admonishment  so no matter which side of the issue you were on the harmless partisanship of a Sunday afternoon in front of the TV was tainted with political poison The number of injured premier players went through the roof  the Giants lost Odell Beckham Jr and three other receivers in one game  and Ryan Shazier a Steelers linebacker whose terrifying spinal injury caused him to lose feeling in his legs is facing a murky future Then there are the endless video reviews and the untenable rule that determines when a catch is or isnt a catch which even the announcers seem unable to parseAnd on top of all of that youre in New York in February after months of living and dying with the Giants 313 andor the Jets 511Super Bowl Cyanide Im thinking it overA sympathetic nod here to the Minnesota fans whose Vikings blew the chance to be the first team to play a Super Bowl in its home stadium with the kind of embarrassing ineptitude in the NFC championship game that lingers for a generation The one time the Super Bowl was played in the Meadowlands in 2014 followed a season in which the Jets and Giants were a collective 1517Its possible Im overreacting My wife Jan is looking forward to the game its a great time to go to the movies she said But I also checked in with some of my footballwatching friendsIts a forced shared event Bob a professor at Yale wrote to me Reminiscent of New Years Eve And anyway its getting difficult to watch football at all without thinking of longterm brain damageAnother pal Josh a television executive wrote Pyrotechnics and overwrought hoopla Its all too loud and too long and theres way too much smoke Exeunt the poor players Bring on the commercialsAnd then Avery a novelist piped up Colin Kaepernick was clearly blackballed in a nasty collusion of NFL owners so tell me why I follow this sportThese guys arent generally so crabby well Avery is but thats another story But they are Giant fans like me Avery is a seasonticket holder maybe thats the explanation Theyre coming over to my place to watch the game We cant agree on who to root for My brother wants the Eagles to lose by 40 but theres a NeverPatriots faction tooIts a Hobsons choice said my friend Amy a theater consultant They both stinkIm not a betting man but I think Philly is going to squeak by Not that that will bring me any satisfaction Thank goodness for the OlympicsAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,sports

AdvertisementSupported byOn Pro FootballTelevision barely showed them and the president made no immediate comments The national conversation was about playoffs not protestsIt was an oddly quiet end to an incredibly loud seasonAmericans ended up arguing over gestures and posture and the original meaning of the lyrics of The StarSpangled Banner What began as a debate over the state of the oppression of people of color became knotted into an argument about patriotism and the military Some cheered the First Amendment and emergency medical workers because who can argue over that but jeered when others exercised those First Amendment rightsNow much of the heat has dissipated if only until the next wrinkle in the protest maybe in the playoffsGames are meant to resolve matters with the finality of a score That is not the case for the biggest sports story of the year Good luck figuring out who won and who lostHow is success measured in protests and counterprotests Is it mere heightened awareness or do we need to point to concrete change Is the goal to create division or cohesion disruption or appeasementOnce the preseason started Malcolm Jenkins of the Philadelphia Eagles raised a fist as his teammate Chris Long put his hand on Jenkinss back It was widely considered the first time a white NFL player took part in the protests but mostly started a seasonlong discussion about what constitutes took partIn Cleveland more than a dozen Browns players knelt in front of the water coolers offending many including the local police union which said it would not participate in flag ceremonies at future games if such conduct continued It did not and when the regular season began a few weeks later the players ran onto the field with police officers emergency medical workers and military personnel everyone locking arms in some sort of chain of unity It will be remembered by some as the seasons high point The Browns went 016Ah but this was 2017 when confusion was merely the first stage of good grief Just as the regular season began the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell was asked if Kaepernick was good enough to play in the leagueIt was the verbal equivalent of starting a barroom brawl Goodell and many team owners responded mostly through tepid prepared statements Players unrestrained took to social media Trump continuedIf a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL or other leagues he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag or Country and should stand for the National Anthem Trump wrote on Twitter part of a series of rhetorical bar stools he lobbed for most of a week If not YOURE FIRED Find something else to doAt least 100 NFL players knelt for the anthem that weekend The Seattle Seahawks and the Tennessee Titans broke league rules by staying inside during the anthem the Titans missed the singer Meghan Linsey taking a knee at the end of her rendition Alejandro Villanueva of the Pittsburgh Steelers came out of the stadium tunnel barely while his teammates stayed behind a miscommunication that thrust them into the fray and made Villanueva an accidental hero among people opposed to the protestsAaron Rodgers posted an Instagram photo of himself kneeling during warmups which Tom Brady liked but both stood for the anthem Their teams like many others linked armsThe protests became a sporting form of interpretive dance What does it mean to take a knee Is it different from sitting What about locking arms Raising a fist Putting your hand on someones shoulder When LeSean McCoy of the Buffalo Bills stretched during the anthem people did mental calisthenics to discern what it meantThings got weird The Dallas Cowboys and the teams owner Jerry Jones who had threatened his players against kneeling knelt and linked arms on the field Then they all stood before the anthem started  a flourish no one quite understoodFans booed The president wrote on Twitter the next morning that the booing was the loudest he had ever heard Great anger he wroteHigh school athletes cheerleaders marching bands police officers city councils rock stars even a football team of 8yearolds and a band playing the anthem for an Oakland As game knelt Some marched to the NFL offices or to the gates of stadiums in shows of solidarityConversely some burned their season tickets or team jerseys and vowed never to watch the NFL again A Missouri bar owner used the jerseys of two wellknown protesting players as doormats to spell out Lynch Kaepernick Plenty including the president blamed or credited the controversy for the NFLs fading television ratings which were on a slide before the protestsThats almost as bad as kneeling the president said on Twitter in November his ire temporarily resurrectedBy then though the number of players kneeling or sitting for the anthem had shrunk back to earlyseason levels a protest movement hard to sustain without a clear vocal leader and goals In places like Seattle and San Francisco where the majority of protesters played anthem rituals became routine barely noticed Even the television networks turned their cameras away having moved onNow at seasons end the top sports story of 2017 already feels like something that has come and gone  or is going at least perhaps just smoldering until it flares again Oppression by any measure hasnt ended or perhaps even slowed Police brutality against people of color remains a major issue Those were not things that would go away quickly if everSo were the protests a success Or does something else have to happen How will history judge the NFL season of 2017Sundays games will not be a memorable part of the story Nine members of the Seahawks sat as they had most of the season while another knelt with a teammates hand on his shoulder Four 49ers knelt Six other teams had at least one player take part the reports said judging by their postureWhen the anthems and the television commercials ended the games and cheers began as if nothing had happened The sideline posturing of 2017 came to a close Fitting for football it will take a long review to determine just what it was that we think we

AdvertisementSupported bySACRAMENTO  Hours before the Sacramento Kings played their NBA home opener in October Vivek Ranadiv stood on the balcony of the teams new fourthfloor office at the 1 billion Downtown Commons He watched hoops fans stream into the yearold Golden 1 Center He smiled at guests swimming in the rooftop pool of the brand new 250room Kimpton Sawyer Hotel Below him the openair plaza at street level bustled with lifeFour years ago this place was dead said Mr Ranadiv referring to downtown Sacramento the capital city of the mostpopulous state in the union Like many cities Sacramentos urban core needed some serious rethinking You could have thrown a bowling ball he said and it wouldnt have hit a soulNo longer Three years after Mr Ranadiv the owner of the Kings partnered with the city to scrape away a nearly empty downtown mall and a year after he opened the arena and the 1millionsquarefoot commons Sacramento is a city rebornThe number of downtown jobs has increased 38 percent according to the Downtown Sacramento Partnership a city economic development group In the last year 27 new stores have opened and 23 others are scheduled to open this year So much construction is happening that the city has decided to hire two dozen new employees to process applications and building permitsAnd Sacramento is not alone Across the country in more than a dozen cities downtowns are being remade as developers abandon the suburbs to combine new sports arenas with mixedused residential retail and office space back in the city The new projects are altering the financial formula for building stadiums and arenas by surrounding them not with mostly idle parking lots in suburban expanses but with revenueproducing stores offices and residences capable of servicing the public debt used to help build these venuesThe explosion in mixeduse developments like these is owed in part to the urban American economic renaissance City populations grew faster from 2010 to 2016 than those in the suburbs reversing a 60year trend that started in 1950 according to census data And cities  not suburbs  are the now primary generators of the nations economic growth according to research compiled by the Federal ReserveIts the onesquaremile effect said Bruce Katz an urban development specialist at the Brookings Institution Downtowns and midtowns possess an enormous amount of value in a relatively small geographyFor years owners used their teams popularity or perceived economic importance to strongarm government officials In many cases owners threatened to move their teams if governments did not build them new stadiums along with the roads and public utilities needed to operate themA 2016 study by the Brookings Institution found that 45 stadiums and arenas for the four major professional sports  football baseball basketball hockey  were constructed or renovated in the United States from 2000 to 2014 at a cost of nearly 28 billion Of that 13 billion was publicly financed with taxexempt bondsBut previous projects that foundered particularly in the 1990s point up the potential risk of these investments What was at work in those deals was the idea that a large public subsidy for a standalone facility would keep the team in place and would stimulate economic activity said Roger Noll emeritus professor of economics at Stanford University The financial catastrophes that occurred convinced cities and residents that multimilliondollar subsidies for standalone stadiums are a loserUrban design specialists also raised their voices in opposition to the old model They noted that generous publicstadium financing ignored almost every facet of sound real estate development like location America was producing a generation of isolated arenas in the suburbs and countryside ringed by giant parking lots many of which sat empty much of the yearThat certainly characterized Detroits comparatively brief experience with suburban sports stadiums In 1975 the NFL Lions moved from the nineacre 63yearold Tigers Stadium in Detroits Corktown neighborhood to the 557 million Silver Dome in Pontiac which was surrounded by over 100 acres of surface parking near the center of the struggling Oakland County city The team stayed until 2002 when it returned to Ford Field a 500 million stadium alongside the twoyearold 300 million Comerica Park the baseball Tigers new home on Woodward Avenue in downtown Detroit Both stadiums were partially financed with taxpayer dollarsLast year Little Caesars Arena opened across the avenue completing a strategic development vision developed by business and civic leaders in the 1990s that focused on professional sports as a catalyst for Detroits revival The NBA Pistons play in the new arena after spending the previous 29 seasons in The Palace of Auburn Hills a 22000seat arena in a prosperous suburb 33 miles north of downtown Detroit that opened in 1988If there is particularly good model for whats happening in Sacramento it can probably be found in Kansas City and the citys Power and Light District The 1 billion 12block district features a 150000squarefoot covered plaza more than 50 restaurants and taverns and hundreds of marketrate apartments It opened in 2007 next to the citys publicly financed 263 million 18500seat Sprint Center which though it does not host a professional team has been frequently used as a site for college basketball games including regional rounds of the annual NCAA tournamentTroy Schulte city manager of Kansas City explained how the project was initially seen as a risk but eventually remade his city and its finances I was budget director at the time he said I was the guy saying I dont know if this is going to pay for itselfThe transition from empty parcels to crowded streets was swift H  R Block opened its 17story 531000 square foot headquarters in the neighborhood in 2006A year later the arena opened and so did a 150000squarefoot KC Live entertainment plaza across the street Office workers strolled the sidewalks by day Thousands more rolled into town for dinner and drinks before concerts and games and stayed afterward to partyMr Schulte and his colleagues have been criticized for a consultants overly enthusiastic estimate that the district would generate sufficient tax revenue to service the bond debt which is 17 million this year The district produces 6 million in revenue from taxes on property sales earnings and utilitiesThat debt was issued with almost no safety cushion a former city councilman Dan Cofran told The Kansas City Star in 2015 It was reckless Mr Cofran said the project should have been smaller and constructed in stagesMr Schulte disagrees He said the city tried to finance the development with a dedicated sales tax which was rejected in a referendum Depleted at its center and stranded in an era of sluggish growth the city pursued what he said was the next best option  selling municipal bonds paid for with revenue from a special taxing districtKansas Citys tax base now raises 8 billion annually with 2 billion from downtown activity Before the Power and Light District opened the citys tax base was 5 billion with 1 billion from downtown There are now 40000 downtown jobs twice as many as a decade agoMr Schulte acknowledges that although tax revenue from the district is steadily increasing it is not clear that enough will be generated to cover the debt service But from the perspective of economic development and economic resurgence he said its the best 300 million weve ever spentSacramentos downtown was ready for a makeover back in 2013 when Mr Ranadiv met with Mayor Kevin Johnson to consider a pitch by David Stern then the NBA commissioner to buy the KingsA growing city of about 480000 and the hub of a sevencounty metropolitan region with 24 million residents Sacramento struggled for years to replace the home of the Kings the 17300seat Sleep Train Arena the smallest in the NBA and which the team had played in since 1988Various proposals to build a new arena in the same area publicly financed with sales tax or other public sources were floated and then sunk two times by failed ballot measures As the venue aged and the Kings consistently lost more games than they won the owners the Maloof brothers sought to sell the team A buyers group from Seattle which lost its own NBA team to Oklahoma City in 2008 was interested But city officials were determined to keep the team  and Mr Ranadiv who had become a Silicon Valley billionaire with the software company he founded was a prime recruit to help make that happenMr Ranadiv had earlier parlayed the success of his company TIBCO Software into a role as vice chairman and coowner of the Golden State Warriors lending him credibility with Mr Stern and Mr Johnson who himself had been an NBA allstar during the 1990sAs part of the pitch Mr Ranadiv and Mr Johnson toured a decrepit downtown mall that would be replaced with a new arena for the Kings The mayor proposed spending 255 million essentially a longterm loan to construct the 560 million facilityMr Ranadiv would be expected to pay the balance plus 65 percent of the citys investment through a 35year lease agreement and property taxes When all was said and done Sacramentos investment in an arena that it would own would be 867 millionThe proposal departed from almost every previous arenafinancing deal Arenaconstruction packages that relied on public investments typically featured taxpayers paying all or nearly all of the development costs without ever being paid backWould Mr Ranadiv biteHe did Visiting downtown Sacramento that day he said he envisioned crowds on the sidewalks and in the space occupied by the nearempty 42yearold mall he saw a plaza surrounded by a stateofthe art arena hotel offices restaurants and stores And he sensed opportunity in a city desperate to keep its NBA franchiseIn May 2013 as the principal investor Mr Ranadiv bought the Kings for 534 million at the time the highest price paid for an NBA franchise up to that date Its since been eclipsed by the 22 billion paid last September for the Houston Rockets In buying the Kings and agreeing to pay for more than half the new arena he hoped to leverage his knowledge in technology sports information and design to not only gain control of a sports franchise but to revive what he considered an important American cityFour years ago I said no other city is going to steal our team Mr Ranadiv said The Kings are the heart and soul of the

undergarments hanging twisted bike frames from the towering arms of saguaros dislodging massive boulders to tumble down sloping mountainsides and setting fire to anything that would burn  abandoned automobiles and trash piles and proud desert plants left to smoke and smolder through the nightThey sound like poorly trained men with not enough to do Yet this is a glancing admission slipped passively into the narrative without elaboration Cant recounts moments of tender connection with frightened injured border crossers But he seems unwilling to look too closely at his complicity in

last third of the book as Jos and his family desperately fight his deportation with Cants considerable help makes a useful contribution to the literature of todays border It lays bare in damning light the casual brutality of the system how unjust laws and private prisons and a militarized border have shattered families and mocked Americas myths about itselfWe mostly arrested the little people Cant

AdvertisementSupported byPLAINVILLE Conn  When William A Petit Jr was campaigning door to door here for a seat in the State Legislature he did not have to worry about getting residents to remember his name They already knew itThe candidate once a successful physician who hailed from a prominent family in this Hartford suburb of 17000 had survived an unimaginable tragedy Nearly 10 years earlier his wife and two daughters were brutally murdered during an hourslong home invasion leaving him beaten and brokenPeople would say they were sorry for what happened to him and he would say Thank you very much Im running for representative recalled Deborah Tompkins a Plainville councilwoman who knocked on doors with Mr Petit a Republican in the fall of 2016 He is a very smooth deflectorFor Mr Petit it was a long painful road from the aftermath of one of the most shocking crimes in Connecticuts history to a seat in the states House of Representatives In between were years of therapy the formation of a foundation to honor his slain familys legacy two murder trials one for each assailant and his unsuccessful effort to block the states repeal of the death penalty a move that led to the resentencing of the convicted killers to life without paroleBut as the 10th anniversary of the killings came and went last July Mr Petit 60 was no longer defined by tragedyMr Petit gave up his diabetes practice immediately after the killings to focus on the foundation But he has deployed his medical expertise in the legislature where he serves on the public health committee At a recent pizza and politics event for constituents he sounded as much the doctor as the politician when asked about legalizing marijuanaAt the moment given the data its hard for me to be in favor of it he said Theres good data that shows that when younger people and even adults use marijuana on a regular basis there are longlasting impacts on IQ decision making and executive functionMr Petit declined to be interviewed for this article his office said that Mr Petit wanted to decrease his personal publicity choosing instead to focus on his family and legislative workFriends and colleagues said that it made sense that Mr Petit would seek a life in public service pointing to his familys longstanding involvement in politics in Plainville where he grew up Im not surprised that he entered politics at all said Ms Tompkins noting that both Mr Petits father and sister served on the town council The Petit family is a big deal in PlainvilleEvery year since the home invasion Bob Heslin a former high school classmate of Mr Petits and Mr Heslins brother Gary have organized a road race to benefit the foundation In the early years turnout was especially large and Mr Petit found himself speaking to crowds of up to 3000 people As Mr Heslin sees it Mr Petit needed a new calling politics was a natural outgrowth of his foundation work and criminaljustice advocacyHe was very successful as a doctor and at the top of his game but after the tragedy he didnt feel comfortable getting back into that for his own reasons Mr Heslin said Possibly he couldnt sit there and give full attention to his patients anymore Through the court process I think he realized that he could be effective and have a positive influence on the politics hereMr Petits colleagues said that while the tragedy was certainly a factor in his public service he has balanced his own history with broader objectives He has backed legislation that would impose tougher penalties on career criminals but also pressed for fiscal restraint joining a bipartisan effort to impose caps on state spendingThere was a time according to interviews Mr Petit has given when he seemed doomed to endlessly replay his familys suffering He himself was beaten with a baseball bat and lost several pints of blood managing to escape moments before the house went up in flamesIn the early months of the foundations existence Mr Petit struggled to make it through meetings without crying He attended every day of each of the two trials fighting off nausea as he neared the courthouse He considered suicideA former neighbor in Cheshire Bob Picozzi remembers emailing Mr Petit at Christmas five months after the attack He said I am putting on my best face but I wish we could just cancel it this year he saidMr Petit considered running for Congress in 2014 but chose to spend more time with his new wife and baby friends said In early 2016 Helen Bergenty then the Plainville town Republican chairwoman telephoned him in Florida where he was vacationing to urge him to run for the State Legislature I said You need to get some experience in Hartford before you run for governor Ms Bergenty recalledIn his first year in office Mr Petit has attended Polish festivals  his sliver of the town of New Britain is heavily Polish  and learned the intricacies of billmaking But Ms Bergenty has not forgotten the governorship especially in a year when the incumbent Dannel P Malloy has decided not to seek reelectionHe would be a terrific governor she said of Mr Petit But hes not ready He would have to campaign all over the state and its very timeconsumingWhatever Mr Petits future holds neighbors and constituents say they are heartened by his transformation People are very happy for him especially anybody who saw him after what happened Ms Tompkins the Plainville councilwoman said That he actually came back to life was such a good thingAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,politics

AdvertisementSupported byAfter months of being lobbied on congestion pricing dozens of New York State Assembly members retreated to a conference room in Albany Those who wanted to speak  not all did  were given a microphone and three minutesOne after another members ticked off why a plan to charge fees for driving cars and trucks into Manhattans most congested neighborhoods was a bad idea It was Manhattancentric with few tangible benefits for the other boroughs Their constituents deeply resented it And if this was about raising money to fix the failing subways there were other ways to do thatThere wasnt a strong appetite for congestion pricing said Assemblyman David I Weprin a Queens Democrat who attended the meeting It wasnt any one thing We had a number of concernsThough few lawmakers came out publicly against the plan it is now clear that congestion pricing was in trouble in the hallways and back rooms of Albany long before it was left out of the new state budget Polling was mixed and even some ardent supporters realized early on that neither the Democratdominated Assembly nor the Republicancontrolled Senate would go along with it  especially in an election yearThe plans best chance had been in the Assembly where New York City is heavily represented and where Carl E Heastie its speaker who represents the Bronx was a supporter of congestion pricing Senate Republican leaders most of whom are from outside the city had expressed displeasure all along about imposing any additional financial burdens on New Yorkers though some Democratic senators had supported the ideaMr Heastie told members that he supported the congestion zone but he also reassured them that he would not try to impose his will on the majority several legislators saidMembers had various concerns about the issue said Michael Whyland a spokesman for Mr Heastie He said conferences about congestion pricing had been going on since last summer and that the Assembly had voted to support more study of the issueIn fact Assembly members from New York City were divided While the congestion zone was backed by some members from Manhattan and Brooklyn others saw it as fundamentally unfair to drivers especially in neighborhoods with few public transit optionsFamilies cannot afford paying additional hundreds of dollars a month on top of the rising costs of living said Assemblyman William Colton of Brooklyn It is unfair to subject workingclass people to these costs without guaranteeing an equal value of increased benefitsThis time around the meltdown of the citys subway system which was not an issue the last time seemed to provide a stronger argument for congestion pricing A state task force assembled by Mr Cuomo called Fix NYC laid out a plan with the congestion zone as the centerpiece and included 2 to 5 surcharges on forhire vehicles including Ubers Lyfts and yellow taxisBut congestion pricing remained a hard sell and not just to lawmakers A Quinnipiac University poll of city voters released the day before the budget agreement found that 52 percent of respondents opposed itIt was an intractable issue said Douglas Muzzio a public affairs professor at Baruch College adding that congestion pricing came with too much baggage to ever really gain steam in Albany It was a massive effort that didnt work  and couldnt work  because of the unalterable opposition of legislators in the outer boroughs and suburban areasSeveral Assembly members who supported congestion pricing said that the lobbying and outreach failed to convey the urgency of the congestion zoneRichard Brodsky a former Democratic assemblyman from Westchester County who led the opposition to a congestion zone in 2008 said that just as before it failed because its supporters were tonedeaf to the financial realities of workingclass and middleclass drivers and made no serious policy effort  no traffic studies no public hearings  to assess the causes of congestion and the impact of the new feesThis has always been a policy nostrum of the elites sort of a big lab test in which the lab rats  the regular people  wanted no part of it he saidAssemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz a Democrat from the Bronx who had previously opposed congestion pricing said he tried to keep an open mind but found that some advocates were unwilling to consider options that could have made it more palatable outside ManhattanThe only people who werent openminded were the congestionpricing absolutists  it was their way or the highway or should I say it was their way or the subway he said When push came to shove this was just not a good optionMr Cuomo who also faces reelection seemed to distance himself when he failed to publicly embrace a congestion zone or include it in his budget amendments according to legislators and advocates Several legislators expecting to be asked for their support said that they waited for phone calls from the governor that never cameSome advocates said he never did enough to move congestion pricing forward as he had with other divisive issues such as samesex marriage and the minimum wageGovernor Cuomos inaction proves he does not understand the magnitude of the crisis  or he just doesnt care said Paul Steely White the executive director of Transportation Alternatives an advocacy groupBut Peter Ajemian a spokesman for Mr Cuomo pointed out that the governor was the one who revived congestion pricing formed the task force and fought for it in budget negotiations The suggestion he didnt do enough is nonsensical he saidKathryn Wylde a member of the task force and president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City a business group said she was told by leaders of both houses as early as February that their members were not ready to pass a congestion zone this yearMany legislators she said were unwilling to support another new fee for the MTA without being able to tell their constituents that they would see a direct benefit such as more express buses Theres a historic unresponsiveness of the MTA bureaucracy to local communities she said Every legislator has a story about how they tried and failed to get their attentionMs Wylde added there was simply not enough time to negotiate with individual legislators for the transit improvements that they wanted in exchange for their support Its a political problem and there wasnt time to work it out she saidAs congestion pricing stalled the governor and his aides tried to salvage the congestion zone by negotiating for authorization of about 200 million to lay the infrastructure for an eventual congestion zone but leave the actual details of how it would operate  such as boundaries fee amounts and hours and any exemptions  until after the electionBut legislators rejected that too I dont think there was ever consensus about a fullthrottled congestion pricing bill said Assemblyman Joseph Lentol a veteran Brooklyn DemocratInstead Mr Lentol and others supported an alternative  a tax on high earners  arguing that wealthy business leaders who earn money from people coming into the city should pay for transit repairs Id prefer that those who benefit from it pay for it Mr Lentol saidNeither the millionaires tax nor the congestion zone made it into the state budget only the surcharges on forhire vehicles whose booming numbers have contributed to congestion The surcharges on rides south of 96th Street  250 in yellow taxis 275 in other forhire vehicles  are expected to raise more than 400 million annually for public transportationIt seemed to be the path of least resistance Mr Weprin saidScott Rechler a member of the governors task force and the MTA board said that as much as 50 million from the new surcharges could be used to make transit improvements outside Manhattan and set the stage for passing a congestion zone next year when the legislators are not concerned about getting reelectedWhenever youre adding a new fee to your constituents there is a political reality to that he said Why take that risk in an election year when you can do it the year afterAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,politics

in the late 19th century that resulted in the slaughter of more than 15000 peasants The novel examines the dangers of utopian fanaticism as well as the destructiveness of an outoftouch government that imagines a threat to its existence where there isnt one  a deadly misunderstanding between rulers and the ruled His other major political novel Feast of the Goat 2000 is a terrifying study of how a dictator with absolute power Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic in this case can colonize even the intimate lives of his countrymen stifling the private freedom to enjoy to appreciate to reason and finally to loveVargas Llosa has also had a prolific career as a journalist and public intellectual Sabers and Utopias is his 25th volume of nonfiction An absorbing collection of essays and newspaper columns about Latin American politics and culture it has the feel of a definitive position paper Written over a period of 35 years these pieces express above all his wish that Latin Americans would finally come to their senses and embrace that most unfairly in his view maligned of political doctrines liberalismWhat he means by liberalism is free elections with no parties excluded a judiciary independent enough to enforce democratic law over the ambitions of powerful individuals freedom of expression for both the press and artists an armed force concerned solely with protecting the country from external threats equal rights for minorities and open capital markets His ardent promotion of the last of these principles has earned him the label neoliberal a term designed Vargas Llosa writes to semantically devalue with the corrosive weapon of derision the doctrine that symbolizes better than any other the extraordinary advances that  freedom has made over the long course of human civilizationThe rudimentary nature of his economic argument has not served him well He acknowledges the danger of powerful multinational companies operating unrestrained in all corners of the earth But his antidote is nothing more than a vague endorsement of fair laws and strong governments In his previous book of essays Notes on the Death of Culture he bemoaned rampant consumerism as the death of serious art and thought yet in Sabers and Utopias he ignores the fact that the lifeblood of giant manufacturers is not the creation of wealth for people who most need it but cheap labor and everexpanding markets His attachment to a pure 18thcentury European liberalism sometimes blinds him to presentday realities that must be reckoned with for liberalism to surviveStill autonomous liberal democracy has had few chances to thrive in Latin America and Vargas Llosas passionate belief in it can be persuasive Its worth pointing out that in the 1960s he was a radical socialist and supporter of Fidel Castro whom he saw along with thousands of other intellectuals at the time as the model for Latin Americas future Disillusionment came when Castro suppressed free speech and imprisoned critics homosexuals and other nonconforming minorities deemed enemies of the revolution A governmentcontrolled economy that led to decades of stagnation seemed to clinch his conversion He began to see Castro not as a revolutionary savior but as one of a long line of dictators from both the left and the right who have kept Latin America in a state of perpetual darknessSince then Vargas Llosas liberalism has been remarkably consistent Far from being a corporate apologist of the right as his detractors have branded him he has encouraged the development of a genuinely democratic left in Peru and has strongly supported leftleaning leaders in Chile Uruguay and Brazil who have attempted to govern in the manner of Spanish and British socialistsIn 1990 running for president of Peru as a pragmatic rightofcenter liberal he lost in a runoff to the populist candidate Alberto Fujimori At the time unemployment was over 50 percent and quadruple digit inflation had rendered the currency virtually worthless The war with the guerrilla group the Shining Path  which ultimately resulted in the murder torture and disappearance of more than 69000 poor and completely innocent Peruvians  was at its height During the presidential campaign a guerrilla commando group planned to assassinate Vargas Llosa and his family at an airport but were discovered before they could attackAs president Fujimori suspended all civil liberties In 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for murders carried out by a military death squad while he was in office Last December the current Peruvian president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski pardoned Fujimori now 79 on medical grounds provoking protests and resignations from members of the government The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for human rights called it a slap in the face for the victims and a major setback for the rule of law in Peru It is enticing to wonder how the country would have fared had Vargas Llosa won the 1990 electionIn Sabers and Utopias Vargas Llosa repeatedly returns to what he regards as Latin Americans chronic weakness for demagogues and phantom utopias This admirer  and practitioner  of magic and illusion in art pleads for bland mediocre reality in politics Why must what is real and possible be continuously rejected in favor of what is imaginary and chimeric His exasperation is almost palpable on the page It is as old as Simn Bolvars lament made shortly before he died in 1830 that America is ungovernable And it echoes the words of his fellow Boom novelist Garca Mrquez who in 1999 called Latin America a laboratory of failed illusions Our main virtue is creativity and yet we have not done much more than live off reheated doctrines and alien warsUnlike Garca Mrquez Vargas Llosa does not resign himself to this state of affairs The contradiction between Latin Americas extravagant creativity and its agonies of injustice and poverty can be overcome with sound laws and reasonable democracy he believes if only poetic metaphors are kept out of politics and stay where they belongThe Neighborhood Vargas Llosas 20th novel is a political mystery of the kind he regularly turns out between his more monumental historical productions The tone perfectly conveyed in Edith Grossmans virtuoso translation is amused and theatrical  realism that never asks the reader to forget it has been neatly contrivedThe subject however couldnt be more serious The story takes place in Lima shortly before the downfall of the Fujimori regime in 2000 The cast of characters includes the star reporter of a vile tabloid magazine who is nourished by finding out other peoples secret shames her flashy unscrupulous editor an impoverished old man who worked in show business until the editor destroyed his career and two complacent upperclass couples who are also best friends The wives pass the time shopping decorating and bossing their servants around while secretly conducting a passionate lesbian love affair The husbands make the money that keeps their bubble from bursting  one is a lawyer at Perus most prestigious firm the other owns a mining company and has extensive international connections as well as an engineering degree from MIT Vargas Llosas portrait of the couples is ambiguous At one moment they are worldly sophisticates doing their best to operate productively in the political barbarism of Peru at the next they are vulgar members of an elite for whom culture comes down to two words whiskey and Miami In the background bombs explode at all hours guerrillas kidnap businessmen government death squads murder indiscriminately and workaday life somehow manages to grind onThe plot slips into gear when the tabloid editor tries to blackmail the mining magnate with explicit photographs from an orgy Vargas Llosa knows how the levers of power in his country work and he uses his story to anatomize the degradation of civic life under Fujimori Vladimiro Montesinos who was the head of Fujimoris secret police emerges as a character in the novel buying the support of journalists and opposition leaders with bags of cash and videotaping the bribes from his compound In these scenes the novelist need hardly invent a word The reallife Montesinos is currently serving time for bribery in a maximumsecurity prison he himself built for his enemiesThe novels hero arises unexpectedly from the lowest depths of the gutter press an inconsequential girl a nobody who on the basis of pure courage changes the lives of Peruvians This seems fitting those toiling in the muck without illusions are best prepared to beat the government at its own gameThe books happy ending reflects its authors belief perhaps in the power of individual morality and will In Sabers and Utopias Vargas Llosa approvingly quotes Karl Poppers dictum that optimism is a duty The future is open  We all contribute to determining it by what we do His steadfast liberalism in the face of state terror military dictatorships violent liberation movements and collapsed economies is his ultimate expression of that dutyMichael Greenberg is the author of a memoir
