AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO  Gary Gensler was one of the top financial regulators in the Obama administration the finance chief for Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign and before both of those jobs a partner at Goldman SachsNow like many other big names from business and government he is plunging into the world of the blockchain the datatracking technology introduced by BitcoinMr Gensler 60 has recently gone to work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he will write and teach about the potential he sees for blockchains to change the financial worldHe will also use his position to warn about how many of the current projects in the world of virtual currencies including some of the biggest are likely to face a significant moment of reckoning with regulatorsMr Gensler is set to say in a speech at MIT on Monday that the second and third most widely used virtual currencies Ether and Ripple have most likely been issued and traded in violation of American securities regulationsThere is a strong case for both of them  but particularly Ripple  that they are noncompliant securities he said in an interview He believes Bitcoin the original virtual currency can remain exempt from securities regulationsMr Gensler will be one of the most influential voices to weigh in on a series of questions that are likely to shape the future of the nascent industryBut Mr Gensler believes that betterknown virtual currencies like Ether and Ripple should be in that conversation as well and should likely be categorized as securities given the way they have been created and sold2018 is going to be a very interesting time Mr Gensler said Over 1000 previously issued initial coin offerings and over 100 exchanges that offer ICOs are going to need to sort out how to come into compliance with US securities lawAll the outstanding Ether were worth around 65 billion at Sundays price while the Ripple tokens in the hands of investors are worth around 35 billionIf they are deemed to be securities it could become illegal for Americans to trade them on most of the exchanges where they are now traded That would make it harder to buy and sell them and depress their pricesMr Gensler developed a reputation for standing up to powerful financial interests when he was the head of the Commodity Futures Trading CommissionBefore he got into office some worried that his background at Goldman Sachs would make him hesitant to take on the big banks But as the chairman of the commission he became one of the most aggressive watchdogs in the effort to rein in Wall Street after the financial crisisJoi Ito the director of the MIT Media Lab and a member of the board of directors of The New York Times said the combination of Mr Genslers record of independence and his knowledge of finance and policy was what made him so attractive to MITMr Ito has built the Digital Currency Initiative at the Media Lab in an effort to gather a collection of virtual currency experts who dont have a financial interest in them though the initiative does provide financial support for some developers working on the Bitcoin softwareIts important that you have a core group of people who arent in it for the money and who care about the proper architecture for the long run he saidMr Gensler has a dual appointment as a special adviser to the Media Lab and a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management where he will teach a class on the blockchain in the fallThe original blockchain is the ledger on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded The Bitcoin blockchain is updated by a network of computers so that no central authority is neededWhile most blockchain experiments are in an early stage Mr Gensler said he had become convinced that blockchains could replace many of the middlemen in the financial industryFor now though his words are likely to have their greatest impact on the quickly evolving debate about how virtual currencies should be regulatedMost industry experts including Mr Gensler assume that Bitcoin is safe from being categorized as a security because it was not originally issued through an initial coin offering or a central organization and the software is maintained by a decentralized group of developers Some other virtual currencies like Litecoin and Monero have similar designsBut Mr Gensler said Ether could have more problems because the first Ether tokens were sold in 2014 before the network was functional by the Ethereum FoundationEther could get off the hook Mr Gensler said because its development has been more decentralized recently and new Ether tokens are now given out to socalled miners through a networkAya Miyaguchi the head of the Ethereum Foundation said in an email that the foundation neither controls the supply of nor has the ability to issue Ether and the quantity of Ether that the foundation holds under 1 percent of all Ether is already lower than that held by many other ecosystem participantsBut Mr Gensler said it would be much harder for the Ripple token known as XRP to avoid being categorized as a security The company that oversees Ripples development still holds most of the XRP tokens and does most of the work to make the software and the token valuable he saidA spokesman for the company Ripple Tom Channick said XRP should not be a securityXRP does not give its owners an interest or stake in Ripple and they are not paid dividends he said XRP exists independent of Ripple was created before the company and will exist after itMr Gensler who has no virtual currency investments said he was not tied to any coins winning the race But he does think changes are necessary before blockchains can go mainstreamI would be surprised if 10 years from now this isnt somewhere in the financial system in a meaningful way he said But so much of the stuff that is being promoted now will not be aroundAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,blockchain
AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO  Last year representatives of 25 countries met in Tokyo to work on setting international standards for the blockchain the technology that was introduced by the virtual currency Bitcoin and has ignited intense interest in corporate and government circlesSome of the technologists at the meeting of the International Standards Organization were surprised when they learned that the head of the Russian delegation Grigory Marshalko worked for the FSB the intelligence agency that is the successor to the KGBThey were even more surprised when they asked the FSB agent why the Russians were devoting such resources to the blockchain standardsLook the internet belongs to the Americans  but blockchain will belong to us he said according to one delegate who was there The Russian added that two other members of his countrys fourperson delegation to the conference also worked for the FSBAnother delegate who had a separate conversation with the head of the Russian group remembers a slightly different wording The internet belonged to America The blockchain will belong to the RussiansBoth of the delegates who recounted their conversations did so on the condition of anonymity because discussions at the International Standards Organization or ISO are supposed to be confidential Neither the Russian organizations overseeing the delegation to the ISO nor the Russian delegates responded to requests for commentThe sentiment expressed by the Russian delegate is as clear a sign as any of the significance that some governments are assigning to the blockchain  a technology that is now being applied to things as varied as financial trading and voting  and the degree to which it is becoming a subject of geopolitical battlesThe Russian interest in the normally wonky technical sessions has caused concern among other delegations who worry that individual countries could push standards that would make the security of the blockchain technology vulnerable to surveillance and attackThe ISO based in Geneva was created in 1947 to ensure that important technologies are built or measured in the same way all over the world Over the years it has created standards for food safety film sensitivity and much moreRussia is not the only country sending highpowered delegations to the ISO technical committee focusing on blockchain standards which got its start last year The 25 countries with committee delegations sent over 130 people to the last meeting to discuss matters like a common method for security China sent officials from the finance ministry while the United States had delegates from IBM and Microsoft according to participantsIt is a very soughtout technology today because it really does create the foundation for the future that is coming said Gilbert Verdian the head of the British delegation working on blockchain standards at the ISO and the founder of the company Quant Network To get behind it and back it now is going to put people at an advantage either politically or economicallyThe original blockchain is the shared database on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded It is kept by a distributed network of computers managed by many people rather than one central authority While there are now many virtual currencies each with its own blockchain there are also many government and corporate efforts looking at ways to use blockchain technology to securely record other kinds of dataThere are still significant questions about whether the technology will live up to expectations  and few projects have proceeded beyond the pilot stage aside from virtual currency networks like Bitcoin and EthereumWithin the young blockchain industry there is a widespread belief that the companies and countries that establish an early lead could guide the direction of the technology for both commercial and national security purposesEmma Channing a lawyer who frequently works with blockchain startups recently raised an alarm about the intrigue at the ISO standards groupMs Channing said she was worried that countries that devote more resources to the process could successfully push their preferred cryptographic algorithms to be the standards potentially creating socalled back doors that could be used in the future to spy on blockchain activityIn the context of software it is the perfect Trojan said Ms Channing a cofounder of the Satis Group an American company that advises blockchain projects If something gets buried in it these things will get adopted wholesale  and wont be questioned on the way inMs Channing recently emailed dozens of blockchain experts trying to get them to volunteer as representatives to the ISO delegations in their countries so that the process does not become dominated by a few countriesThe chairman of the ISO blockchain committee Craig Dunn rejected the idea that any country could shape the process While ISO proceedings are generally confidential new standards must go through many stages with many rounds of voting  first with smaller working groups and then with full national delegationsThere has to be agreement and consensus across the member countries to take a standard forward said Mr Dunn who is also the head of the Australian delegation to the committeeAnother member of the Russian delegation Alexey Urivskiy told the Russian newspaper Vedomosti last year that the delegation at the ISO committee was supposed to get Russian cryptographic algorithms into the standard The Vedomosti article said that the head of the Russian ISO delegation Mr Marshalko was affiliated with the FSBRussia is not the only country pushing hard on the blockchain Many Chinese government offices have been public about their interest in taking advantage of the blockchain technology for tasks like tracking people and products moving through industrial supply chainsAt the ISO meetings last fall in Tokyo the Chinese government sent one of the largest delegations with at least nine people including representatives from the finance ministry and the Chinese central bank according to a delegate from another country who met the Chinese participantsThe United States delegation was led at the last meeting by a Microsoft employee and included a delegate from IBM Microsoft and IBM are two of the global companies that have pushed hardest to develop blockchain technologyAt the first meeting of the ISO blockchain group the Russian delegation led a study group on security and privacy issues which caused discomfort among some delegates from other countries according to the two delegates who spoke to The New York Times At a second meeting oversight for these issues was transferred to a working group led by FranceMr Verdian the head of the British group said lots of delegations were jockeying to get an edge on the new technologyIt will change how our society can operate but at the same time in harnessing this technology people might want to leverage that for their own gain he said We all owe it to each other to do it right so that it benefits all of us rather than a fewOleg Matsnev contributed reporting from

AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO  Worried about someone hacking the next election Bothered by the way Facebook and Equifax coughed up your personal informationThe technology industry has an answer called the blockchain  even for the problems the industry helped to createNow countless entrepreneurs companies and governments are looking to use similar databases  often independent of Bitcoin  to solve some of the most intractable issues facing societyPeople feel the need to move away from something like Facebook and toward something that allows them to have ownership of their own data said Ryan Shea a cofounder of Blockstack a New York company working with blockchain technologyBlockchain allows information to be stored and exchanged by a network of computers without any central authority In theory this egalitarian arrangement also makes it harder for data to be altered or hackedMost of the projects have not gotten beyond pilot testing and many are aimed at transforming mundane corporate tasks like financial trading and accounting But some experiments promise to transform fundamental things like the way we vote and the way we interact onlineThere is just so much it can do said Bradley Tusk a former campaign manager for Michael R Bloomberg the former mayor of New York who has recently thrown his weight behind several blockchain projects I love the fact that you can transmit data information and choices in a way that is really hard to hack  really hard to disrupt and that can be really efficientMr Tusk the founder of Tusk Strategies is an investor in some large virtual currency companies He has also supported efforts aimed at getting governments to move voting online to blockchainbased systems Mr Tusk argues that blockchains could make reliable online voting possible because the votes could be recorded in a tamperproof wayEverything is moving toward people saying I want all the benefits of the internet but I want to protect my privacy and my security he said The only thing I know that can reconcile those things is the blockchainBlockchains assemble data into socalled blocks that are chained together using complicated math Since each block is built off the last one and includes information like time stamps any attempt to go back and alter existing data would be highly complicated In the original Bitcoin blockchain the data in the blocks is information about Bitcoin wallets and transactions The blocks of data in the Bitcoin blockchain  and most of its imitators  are kept by a peertopeer computer networkThese experiments have drawn skepticism from Bitcoin aficionados who say blockchains are being applied to problems that could be more easily solved with oldfashioned databasesOther critics say the rapid pace of blockchain development could lead to the same problem facing the broader tech industry a willingness to disrupt and overthrow old systems before the replacement has been thoroughly testedThe blockchain industry is ready and waiting to say Yes we are the solution and they have every incentive to do so said Angela Walch a research fellow at the Center for Blockchain Technologies at University College London But somebody needs to ask the question Is it actually better Is it measurably betterMany blockchain projects opened themselves to criticism and regulatory scrutiny by raising money through socalled initial coin offerings last year These fundraising campaigns often brought in tens of millions of dollars in minutes with little regulatory oversightBut new blockchain efforts continue apace motivated in no small part by concerns about the emergence of internet giants like Facebook and YouTubeMost of the biggest internet companies make their money from collecting personal information and using it to sell targeted advertisements This kind of massive data collection makes them vulnerable to hackers and outsiders who want to leverage the data  as was evident when Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to 50 million Facebook profiles And startups are using the blockchain in an attempt to pry control of all that data out of their handsBlockstack has built a way to record the basic details about your identity on a blockchain database and then use that identity to set up accounts with other online projects that are built on top of itThe animating force behind the project is that users  rather than Blockstack or any other company  would end up in control of all the data they generate with any online serviceBlockstack is one of several blockchainbased projects hoping to create a new generation of online services that dont rely on having unfettered access to our personal informationThe idea has gained enough steam that in the days after news of Facebooks relationship with Cambridge Analytica broke Twitter was filled with people calling for blockchainbased alternativesEven blockchain advocates say the hype has conditioned people to think that good answers are close at hand when it could take five or 10 years for the technology to properly developIn fact most blockchain projects are still plagued by concerns about privacy For example the widely used Bitcoin blockchain allows certain data  details of the transactions between users  to be seen by anyone even if other data  the users identities  remains obscured Voting startups have solved this by encrypting the data before putting it on a blockchain but there are questions about whether this will solve other privacy concernsBlockchainbased accounts also rely on users keeping their own passwords or private keys which people are famously bad at doing With Bitcoin when people lose their private key they lose access to the money in their account  if someone lost the private key to a blockchainbased online account they could lose access to their identityWere not saying that tomorrow you can flip the switch and a blockchain is going to solve these problems said Michael Casey a coauthor of The Truth Machine a new book on the blockchain Whats important is how it opens the door to a new way of thinking about the problems we faceAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,blockchain

AdvertisementSupported byEssaySometimes life shows you what absurd really is This is one of those times Im talking about the phenomenon known as Bitcoin a monetary system based on computation complex algorithms and  lets face it  communal delusionSo whats the problemLet me answer that question with a question What do you know about tulips Yes I am referring to the Dutch tulip craze back in the 17th century and the speculative bubble that preceded the stock market crash of 1929 and the dotcom boom and crash that started in the late 1990s Remember that last one when learned analysts told us that advancing technology had eliminated the business cycleGood times No bubble is too big to burstBut hey no regrets Carpe Bitcoin But not literallyI called Christian Day a professor at Syracuse University law school who has written about bubbles and panics He said that comparing Bitcoin to the tulip craze was unfair to tulips The Dutch were not as crazy as theyve been portrayedFor one thing the tulip bulbs were real he said and the hybrids that were the subject of speculation could be extremely valuable Whats more much of the trading was done by people who knew their horticulture With the modern technotulips he said I dont think theres anything thereSome of the most skeptical folks are experts in cryptography and computer security Steven Bellovin an adept in computer security and a professor at Columbia University told me that the technology is still too buggy a lab experiment that escaped into the wild Its hard to trust a currency he said thats backed by the full faith and credit of software that has to be updated monthlyOuch currency guys Well you can afford some very expensive salves for those burns For nowFor another point of view  because Im all about evenhandedness people  I checked with Jim Harper executive vice president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute He served on the board of the Bitcoin Foundation and says the promise of Bitcoin is to create a payment system people can use anywhere in the world with privacy and security He says its true value will be in commerce not speculationWell that hasnt happened yet the price is too unstable He said the currency will move beyond some of the early notorious uses in illegal commerce As for the tulip comparisons he joked Laugh all you want My initial coin offering for cryptotulips will be worth billionsI have discovered that the cryptocurrency revolution has reached my own family My 22yearold son told me that he had tried to buy a bit of a Bitcoin a few weeks ago and actually lost the money It was his cash to spend so there was no lecturing him about it But I did ask why he had tried to invest in Bitcoin when hes shown little interest in say mutual fundsHe said that he had been unaware of the speculation in Bitcoin Instead he said he was trying to use it for precisely what Mr Harper says it will be best for currency transactions with vendors who do not accept for example debit cards or PayPalWhat I was actually trying to do was buy porn he said patiently From JapanAs I said hes a millennial full of that generations bracing honesty Im glad he told me but I sure dont need to know more about the particular transaction except for the clarifying fact that this vendor would take BitcoinHe said he followed the instructions and created a wallet and went to an exchange and after entering a great deal of personal information bought a small fraction of a bitcoin  in fact 0005 of one the lowest quantity you could purchase on the site Then he found that he couldnt figure out how to get to his money grew frustrated and gave up Well I told him losing 70 bucks is hardly ruinous its more like the cost of an educationAs we discussed the aborted transaction he grabbed his laptop and took another look at the exchange siteOh he said I got in A calmer state of mind had led to successThe result Ive got 000545679 Bitcoin he said reading off the screen which is now worth  96 In the time the money had been locked up it had jumped in value by about a third This has been a profitable eveningTell me about it In sheer percentage terms his little investment outperformed my 401ks return for an entire yearNow I am trying to figure out how to cash in on all of this though without buying Bitcoin myself Its exactly the kind of market that a fool like me might be tempted to rush into but Ive learned enough over the years to know that by the time I finally try the hot new thing it is already cold and old I am the maker of markets the loser who helps to create winnersInstead maybe Ill just pull a Long Island Iced Tea and change my name to Blockchain Schwartz It has a nice ring to it But thats just a startI think Ill write all of my articles from now on in an encrypted

AdvertisementSupported byPALO ALTO Calif  When a cryptocurrency startup that promised to revolutionize the fruit and vegetable industry shut down last month it left behind one word on its website penisWhen a virtual currency company called DateCoin recently tried to entice investors for its initial coin offering it posted a Facebook ad that featured a reclining woman in a swimsuit with text over her body that read Touch my ICOAnd after the North American Bitcoin Conference in January which highlighted 84 male speakers and three women the official conference party was held at a Miami strip clubNow some early female investors and entrepreneurs are beginning to sound the alarm and push backSome crypto leaders are now organizing events clubs and conferences to attract women to the industry Ms Bonatsos spoke at one such event this month in San Francisco And Jalak Jobanputra founder of the startup investment firm Future Perfect Ventures and other blockchain developers gathered in New York this month to discuss the issue They later announced that they would form a blockchain diversity advocacy group called the Collective Future and create a diversity pledge for crypto companies to sign as a show of commitmentThe early days are what decide the culture of an industry and who gets involved in making the decisions Ms Jobanputra said She cited the venture capitalists who funded eBay and Amazon and whom they funded nextWomen always question if theyre qualified she said But look at these clowns around usThe response to some of the events has been encouraging some of the women said Brit Morin a Silicon Valley entrepreneur recently held a blockchain gathering for women that sold out in an hour She moved the meeting to a bigger venue where all 500 seats sold out again So she set up a livestream for the event that evening 16000 viewers joined to watchWe have an opportunity to rebuild the financial systems Ms Morin said Women want to be part of thatThe resistance follows increasing outrage at the lack of diversity in virtual currencies punctuated by the sexist incidents involving DateCoins Facebook ad and Prodeum the blockchainforfruit startup Neither company returned requests for commentIt just coincidentally happened that there were more men than women speakers Mr Levin said Its not intentional not to include them Its just we dont have time to include themWhen others in the cryptocurrency industry realized the conferences afterparty would be held at a strip club they encouraged Mr Levin to change locations He said the strip club was the most convenient and safest venue he could findDowntown Miami doesnt have a whole lot of event spaces Mr Levin said And we needed a lot of securityThe year before the conferences kickoff party featured underwearclad models  painted gold and covered in Bitcoin logosMoe does something just as sexist every year said Rose Chan who founded the World Banks blockchain working group and now runs her own cryptocurrency project He switches it up which actually means that he thinks about itOne group of female investors said they had decided to boycott the conference in the futureMr Levin said this reaction surprised him Theres so many people who had a great time he saidAt some womenincrypto events frustration is giving way to anger and sadness On a recent night about 50 young women interested in cryptocurrencies gathered at the Womans Club of Palo Alto Some were engineering students at nearby Stanford UniversityOver wine they shared their stories  some had been mistaken for hired models others propositioned during job interviews and many men had not believed they were engineers at allCatheryne Nicholson the chief executive of BlockCypher which provides infrastructure for blockchain applications explained to some of the younger women why the gender situation had deterioratedNow theres a lot of money and the men think Oh Im a whale now she said Theyre a little more full of themselvesKaren Hsu BlockCyphers head of growth said she thought some of the gender concerns had been overstated She said that at a recent conference she had been asked if she was a speaker which was validatingIt was nice because he didnt think I was a booth babe Ms Hsu said referring to hired models who stand near the booths of startups to draw the attention of conference attendeesOther women spoke about how the culture of blockchain was slowly wearing them down Jay Graber a developer at Zcash a new cryptocurrency aimed at enhanced privacy was wearing small green earrings she had made out of RAM sticks used in cryptocurrency gear She said she had become interested in blockchain after joining the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011 and she viewed the technology as a tool that could take power away from big central banks Now shes not so sureI never felt insecure before I got into this space Ms Graber said But I just realized there is no one else like me It is a very hard feeling when you dont see anyone who is like youMs Graber said she had considered leaving the industryI have this perpetual sense of being on the outside of that conversation she said Its just a general state of

AdvertisementSupported byThe offering was part of a broader but still very private push that the firm was making into the nascent world of cryptocurrencies over the last yearThe goal of Cambridge Analyticas own coin offering Raise money that would pay for the creation of a system to help people store and sell their online personal data to advertisers Brittany Kaiser a former Cambridge Analytica employee said in an interview The idea was to protect information from more or less what the firm did when it obtained the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook usersWho knows more about the usage of personal data than Cambridge Analytica Ms Kaiser said So why not build a platform that reconstructs the way that worksThe effort was overseen by Cambridge Analyticas British chief executive Alexander Nix who was forced out of the company in March after he was caught on tape bragging about his companys approach to political work in other countries including the use of shell companies and strategies designed to entrap opponents The Facebook data revelations and Mr Nixs comments appear to have put the virtual currency work which was still in the early stages on holdThere are only a handful of more controversial areas it could have expanded its business into said Tim Swanson a consultant to companies in the industry who was briefed on the Cambridge Analytica coin offeringA spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to multiple requests for commentCambridge Analytica boasts that its psychographic profiles of voters and consumers allow for more persuasive and precisely targeted advertising In marketing material sent to investors the firm said Ms Kaiser was helping blockchain companies in using predictive modeling to target investors for token salesJill Carlson a consultant who has worked with several blockchain companies attended meetings where Cambridge Analytica pitched its services to virtual currency companies including one that Mr Nix attendedMs Carlson said the Cambridge Analytica employees had bragged about their success in helping get President Trump elected and their ability to carefully target advertising campaigns using data from social networks like FacebookShe also remembers they spoke about an array of potential campaigns The most unusual idea involved sending virtual currencies to people in farflung regions of Mexico The payments would give people incentive to fill out surveys and get data that could then be used to help design campaigns for Mexican political candidatesMs Carlson said the pitch was contrary to the ideas of openness and transparency that drew her to virtual currency projects like BitcoinThe way that Cambridge Analytica was talking about it they were viewing it as a means of being able to basically inflict government control and private corporate control over individuals which just takes the whole initial premise of this technology and turns it on its head in this very dystopian way she saidCambridge Analytica did win over some clients Last summer Ms Kaisers team began working with Dragon Coin a new virtual currency that was designed to be used by gamblers The coin was supposed to make it easier for people to get their money to casinos in Macau an island that is technically a part of China with some independent political structuresBut documents sent in September to potential investors by Dragon Coins cofounder Paul Moynan listed Mr Wan as the sponsor of the initial coin offering and included his picture Ms Kaiser was included in the email A separate Dragon Coin document that Mr Moynan sent out at the same time listed Mr Wan as one of a few highprofile supporters of the projectWhen reached recently Mr Moynan initially said that his email address had been hacked and that he did not recognize the documents He later said the documents were a hypothetical wish list of a junior staff memberWe will be conducting an internal investigation as unfinished draft documents would never have been indicative of actual agreed partnerships he saidMs Kaiser said that her work on the Dragon Coin event in Macau had been done in a personal capacity and that the Dragon Coin team had told her that Mr Wan was not involved with the projectDragon Coin claimed it raised more than 300 million from investors last fall That total has been hard to verify Like many coin offerings Dragon Coin has failed to live up to its promisesThe document sent to investors in September said Dragon Coin had secured a partnership with Visa to release a debit card that would work on the Visa network A spokeswoman for Visa said that there was no partnership and that no Dragon card had been approved as is necessary for a card to be issuedThe setbacks did not stop Cambridge Analytica from plunging further into the virtual currency realm The companys New York office continued reaching out to potential investors and partners emails show And in January Ms Kaiser hosted a side conference dedicated to blockchain projects known as CryptoHQ at the World Economic Forums annual conference in Davos Switzerland Mr Nix spoke on a panel at the eventHe said that the technology would be helpful in solving the very problems that Cambridge Analytica has since become the emblem of  the abuse of online personal dataWere going to see a new type of economy emerging where people can start to take ownership of their data and monetize on their data Mr Nix said according to a tweet from the CryptoHQ account And that is only possible through the blockchainThe virtual currency that Cambridge Analytica was designing was aimed at exactly this problem and would have also helped the company raise money from investorsNathaniel Popper reported from San Francisco and Nicholas Confessore from New

ady dominate the ridesharing market This is where the tokens come in Early adopters of Transit would be rewarded with Transit tokens which could themselves be used to purchase Transit services or be traded on exchanges for traditional currency As in the Bitcoin model tokens would be doled out less generously as Transit grew more popular In the early days a developer who built an iPhone app that uses Transit might see a windfall of tokens Uber drivers who started using Transit as a second option for finding passengers could collect tokens as a reward for embracing the system adventurous consumers would be rewarded with tokens for using Transit in its early days when there are fewer drivers available compared with the existing proprietary networks like Uber or LyftAs Transit began to take off it would attract speculators who would put a monetary price on the token and drive even more interest in the protocol by inflating its value which in turn would attract more developers drivers and customers If the whole system ends up working as its advocates believe the result is a more competitive but at the same time more equitable marketplace Instead of all the economic value being captured by the shareholders of one or two large corporations that dominate the market the economic value is distributed across a much wider group the early developers of Transit the app creators who make the protocol work in a consumerfriendly form the earlyadopter drivers and passengers the first wave of speculators Token economies introduce a strange new set of elements that do not fit the traditional models instead of creating value by owning something as in the shareholder equity model people create value by improving the underlying protocol either by helping to maintain the ledger as in Bitcoin mining or by writing apps atop it or simply by using the service The lines between founders investors and customers are far blurrier than in traditional corporate models all the incentives are explicitly designed to steer away from winnertakeall outcomes And yet at the same time the whole system depends on an initial speculative phase in which outsiders are betting on the token to rise in valueAdvertisementYou think about the 90s internet bubble and all the great infrastructure we got out of that Dixon says Youre basically taking that effect and shrinking it down to the size of an applicationPlanted in industrial Bushwick a stones throw from the pizza mecca Robertas headquarters seemed an unlikely word The front door was festooned with graffiti and stickers inside the stairwells of the space appeared to have been last renovated during the Coolidge administration Just about three years old the ConsenSys network now includes more than 550 employees in 28 countries and the operation has never raised a dime of venture capital As an organization ConsenSys does not quite fit any of the usual categories It is technically a corporation but it has elements that also resemble nonprofits and workers collectives The shared goal of ConsenSys members is strengthening and expanding the Ethereum blockchain They support developers creating new apps and tools for the platform one of which is MetaMask the software that generated my Ethereum address But they also offer consultingstyle services for companies nonprofits or governments looking for ways to integrate Ethereums smart contracts into their own systemsThe true test of the blockchain will revolve  like so many of the online crises of the past few years  around the problem of identity Today your digital identity is scattered across dozens or even hundreds of different sites Amazon has your creditcard information and your purchase history Facebook knows your friends and family Equifax maintains your credit history When you use any of those services you are effectively asking for permission to borrow some of that information about yourself in order perform a task ordering a Christmas present for your uncle checking Instagram to see pictures from the office party last night But all these different fragments of your identity dont belong to you they belong to Facebook and Amazon and Google who are free to sell bits of that information about you to advertisers without consulting you You of course are free to delete those accounts if you choose and if you stop checking Facebook Zuckerberg and the Facebook shareholders will stop making money by renting out your attention to their true customers But your Facebook or Google identity isnt portable If you want to join another promising social network that is maybe a little less infected with Russian bots you cant extract your social network from Twitter and deposit it in the new service You have to build the network again from scratch and persuade all your friends to do the sameThe blockchain evangelists think this entire approach is backward You should own your digital identity  which could include everything from your date of birth to your friend networks to your purchasing history  and you should be free to lend parts of that identity out to services as you see fit Given that identity was not baked into the original internet protocols and given the difficulty of managing a distributed database in the days before Bitcoin this form of selfsovereign identity  as the parlance has it  was a practical impossibility Now it is an attainable goal A number of blockchainbased services are trying to tackle this problem including a new identity system called uPort that has been spun out of ConsenSys and another one called Blockstack that is currently based on the Bitcoin platform Tim BernersLee is leading the development of a comparable system called Solid that would also give users control over their own data These rival protocols all have slightly different frameworks but they all share a general vision of how identity should work on a truly decentralized internetGutterman suggests that the same kind of system could be applied to even more critical forms of identity like health care data Instead of storing say your genome on servers belonging to a private corporation the information would instead be stored inside a personal data archive There may be many corporate entities that I dont want seeing that data but maybe Id like to donate that data to a medical study she says I could use my blockchainbased selfsovereign ID to allow one group to use it and not another Or I could sell it over here and give it away over thereThe token architecture would give a blockchainbased identity standard an additional edge over closed standards like Facebooks As many critics have observed ordinary users on socialmedia platforms create almost all the content without compensation while the companies capture all the economic value from that content through advertising sales A tokenbased social network would at least give early adopters a piece of the action rewarding them for their labors in making the new platform appealing If someone can really figure out a version of Facebook that lets users own a piece of the network and get paid Dixon says that could be pretty compellingAdvertisementWould that information be more secure in a distributed blockchain than behind the elaborate firewalls of giant corporations like Google or Facebook In this one respect the Bitcoin story is actually instructive It may never be stable enough to function as a currency but it does offer convincing proof of just how secure a distributed ledger can be Look at the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum 80 billion 25 billion whatever Dixon says That means if you successfully attack that system you could walk away with more than a billion dollars You know what a bug bounty is Someone says If you hack my system Ill give you a million dollars So Bitcoin is now a nineyearold multibilliondollar bug bounty and no ones hacked it It feels like pretty good proofAdditional security would come from the decentralized nature of these new identity protocols In the identity system proposed by Blockstack the actual information about your identity  your social connections your purchasing history  could be stored anywhere online The blockchain would simply provide cryptographically secure keys to unlock that information and share it with other trusted providers A system with a centralized repository with data for hundreds of millions of users  what security experts call honey pots  is far more appealing to hackers Which would you rather do steal a hundred million credit histories by hacking into a hundred million separate personal computers and sning around until you found the right data on each machine Or just hack into one honey pot at Equifax and walk away with the same amount of data in a matter of hours As Gutterman puts it Its the difference between robbing a house versus robbing the entire villageMuch has been made of the anarcholibertarian streak in Bitcoin and other nonfiat currencies the community is rife with words and phrases selfsovereign that sound as if they could be slogans for some militia compound in Montana And yet in its potential to break up large concentrations of power and explore lessproprietary models of ownership the blockchain idea offers a tantalizing possibility for those who would like to distribute wealth more equitably and break up the cartels of the digital ageThe blockchain worldview can also sound libertarian in the sense that it proposes nonstate solutions to capitalist excesses like information monopolies But to believe in the blockchain is not necessarily to oppose regulation if that regulation is designed with complementary aims Brad Burnham for instance suggests that regulators should insist that everyone have a right to a private data store where all the various facets of their online identity would be maintained But governments wouldnt be required to design those identity protocols They would be developed on the blockchain open source Ideologically speaking that private data store would be a true team effort built as an intellectual commons funded by token speculators supported by the regulatory stateLike the original internet itself the blockchain is an idea with radical  almost communitarian  possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed at least where baselayer issues are concerned But we dont have an easy route back to the openprotocol era Some messianic nextgeneration internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research the way

are changing the name They will call it SolAnd these men  because they are almost exclusively men  have a plan for what to do with the wealth They want to build a crypto utopia a new city where the money is virtual and the contracts are all public to show the rest of the world what a crypto future could look like Blockchain a digital ledger that forms the basis of virtual currencies has the potential to reinvent society  and the Puertopians want to prove itSo this crypto community flocked here to create its paradise Now the investors are spending their days hunting for property where they could have their own airports and docks They are taking over hotels and a museum in the capitals historic section called Old San Juan They say they are close to getting the local government to allow them to have the first cryptocurrency bankThe territorys goto blockchain tax lawyer is Giovanni Mendez 30 He expected the tax expatriates to disappear after Hurricane Maria but the population has instead boomedIts increased monumentally said Mr Mendez who has about two dozen crypto clients And they all came togetherThe movement is alarming an earlier generation of Puerto Rico tax expats like the hedge fund manager Robb Rill who runs a social group for those taking advantage of the tax incentivesThey call me up saying theyre going to buy 250000 acres so they can incorporate their own city literally start a city in Puerto Rico to have their own crypto world said Mr Rill who moved to the island in 2013 I cant engage in thatThe newcomers are still debating the exact shape that Puertopia should take Some think they need to make a city others think its enough to move into Old San Juan Puertopians said however that they hoped to move very fastYouve never seen an industry catalyze a place like youre going to see here Mr Minor saidUntil the Puertopians find land they have descended on the Monastery a 20000squarefoot hotel they rented as their base and that was largely unscathed by the hurricaneMatt Clemenson and Stephen Morris were drinking beer on the Monasterys roof one recent evening Mr Clemenson had an easygoing affect and wore twotone aviators Mr Morris a loquacious British man was in cargo shorts and laceup steeltoed combat boots with a smartphone on a necklace They wanted to make two things clear They chose Puerto Rico because of the hurricane and they come in peaceIts only when everythings been swept away that you can make a case for rebuilding from the ground up Mr Morris 53 saidWere benevolent capitalists building a benevolent economy said Mr Clemenson 34 a cofounder of Lotterycom which is using the blockchain in lotteries Puerto Rico has been this hidden gem this enchanted island thats been consistently overlooked and mistreated Maybe 500 years later we can make it rightCompassion respect financial transparency Mr Pierce said when asked what was guiding them hereMr Pierce the director of the Bitcoin Foundation is a major figure in the crypto boom He cofounded a blockchainforbusiness startup BlockOne which has sold around 200 million of a custom virtual currency EOS in a socalled initial coin offering The value of all the outstanding EOS tokens is around 65 billionDownstairs in the Monastery penthouse a dozen or so other expats were hanging out The water was out that night so the toilets and faucets were dry Mr Minor lounged on an alcove chaiseThe US doesnt want us Its trying to choke off this economy Mr Minor said referring to the difficulties that crypto investors have with American banks There needs to be a place where people are free to inventMr Pierce paced the room with his hands in fists A few times a day he played a video for the group on his phone and a portable speaker Charlie Chaplins 1940 The Great Dictator in which Chaplin parodies Hitler rallying his forces He finds inspiration in lines like More than machinery we need humanityIm worried people are going to misinterpret our actions Mr Pierce said That were just coming to Puerto Rico to dodge taxesHe said he was aiming to create a charitable token called ONE with 1 billion of his own money If you take the MY out of money youre left with ONE Mr Pierce saidHes tuned in to a higher calling said Kai Nygard scion of the Canadian clothing company Nygard and a crypto investor Hes beyond moneyThe force of Mr Pierces personality and his spiritual presence are important to the group whose members are otherwise largely agnostic Mr Pierce regularly performs rituals Earlier that day while scoping out property they had stopped at a historic Ceiba tree known as the Tree of LifeBrock nestled into the bosom of it and was there for 10 minutes Mr Nygard saidMr Pierce walked around the tree and said prayers for Puertopia holding a rusted wrench he had picked up in the territory He kissed an old mans feet He blessed a crystal in the water as they all watched He played the Chaplin speech to everyone and to the tree Mr Nygard saidThat wrench is now in the penthouse heavy and greasyMr Pierce had fallen asleep by then his hat tilted down and arms crossed He gets two hours of sleep many nights often on a firm grounding mat to stay in contact with the earths electric energy Josh Boles a tall athletic man who is another crypto expat picked him up and the group headed back to the MonasteryThey walked past a big pink building in an old town square the start of their vision for Puertopias downtown Once a childrens museum they plan on making it a crypto clubhouse and outreach center that will have the mission to bring together Puerto Ricans with PuertopiansWorkdays are casual in Puertopia One morning Bryan Larkin 39 and Reeve Collins 42 were working at another old hotel the Condado Vanderbilt where they had their

create their own moneyHe had moved from Santa Monica Calif with just a few bags and was now starting a local cryptocurrency incubator called Vatom FactoryWhen Brock said Were moving to Puerto Rico for the taxes and to create this new town I said Im in Mr Collins said Sight unseenThey soon went back to work checking out Coinmarketcapcom a site that shows the price of cryptocurrenciesOur market caps

welcome infusion of investment and ideasWere open for crypto business said Erika MedinaVecchini the chief business development officer for the Department of Economic Development and Commerce in an interview at her office She said her office was starting an ad campaign aimed at the new crypto expat boom with the tagline Paradise PerformsOthers worry about the islands being used for an experiment

spend moneyAndria Satz 33 who grew up in Old San Juan and works for the Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico disagreedWere the tax playground for the rich she said Were the test case for anyone who wants

AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftAn eon or two ago Eastman Kodak was a bleedingedge technology company It hired the smartest engineers and put them to work racking up patents pioneering new chemical processes and building a globespanning camera and film business that at its peak employed 145000 peopleNow the 130yearold company is trying an unlikely sort of comeback  one built by betting on cryptocurrency Its a bold gamble that has excited some investors perplexed others and raised questions about how closely Kodak vetted its cryptocurrency business partners who now include a paparazzi photo agency a pennystock promoter and a company offering what has been called a magic money making machineKodaks stock rose more than 200 percent following the announcements and has not fallen much sinceKodak is the most prominent oldline company to enter the cryptocurrency game so far and maybe the most controversial Almost immediately critics pounced on the companys plans characterizing them as a desperate money grabIt feels like a publicly traded company issuing a token to raise its stock price from the grave said Kyle Samani a partner at the cryptocurrency trading firm Multicoin CapitalI would not be sleeping very well if I was involved in this said Jill Carlson a blockchain consultantIn an interview Jeff Clarke Kodaks chief executive said that the companys blockchain ambitions were genuine He began looking into blockchain technology last summer he said and realized that it could solve a perennial problem for photographers  proving ownership of their images tracking down copyright violators and getting paidThis is not a dog food company thats creating a currency Mr Clarke said This is a real solution around digital rights management that Kodak has been involved in for many yearsIn theory photographers will be able to upload their images to a platform called KodakOne create a blockchainbased license for each image and use webcrawling software to scour the internet looking for copyright violations Instead of using dollars photographers can have clients pay them in KodakCoinsKodakCoins initial offering scheduled for Wednesday is expected to raise as much as 20 million On Tuesday night KodakCoins website said that it would delay the offering by several weeks to verify the credentials of potential investors But there are few details about what that money will be used for or why a similar system could not be built without the blockchain There is also a more obvious question Why would photographers want to be paid in digital tokens rather than cashIn several calls with KodakCoin leaders I couldnt get straight answers to these questions And KodakCoins white paper a technical document that details the plans for the currency is a 40page mishmash of marketing buzzwords and vague diagrams like the one belowMake no mistake Digital rights management is a real issue for photographers and the blockchain does in theory offer a compelling solution But the specific attributes of KodakCoin present some red flagsFirst despite the name KodakCoin is not actually a Kodak project The company behind the offering WENN Digital is a Californiabased affiliate of a British photo agency that specializes in paparazzi photo licensing Under their licensing agreement Kodak will not receive any direct revenue from the public offering It will receive a minority stake in WENN Digital 3 percent of all KodakCoins issued and a royalty on future revenueCameron Chell a lead adviser to the KodakCoin project told me that the initial offering represented a seminal moment for Kodak and that the companys interest in blockchain technology was a savvy longterm investmentThe real story is that its about to be a renaissance he saidAsked about these incidents Mr Chell said that he was young inexperienced and was irresponsible in my actions and that he had learned a lot since 1998 and work hard to conduct myself in a manner that does not reflect that poor judgment A Kodak spokesman did not return a request for comment about Mr Chell and whether it knew about the banMr Chell has refashioned himself as a blockchain expert in recent years and KodakCoin is his biggest project so far He is the chairman of Appcoin Innovations which was registered as a literary agency  Redstone Literary Agents  until last year when it became a consulting firm that provides a turnkey set of services for companies to develop and integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies according to securities filingsThe company which trades over the counter as a penny stock earned no revenue in 2015 or 2016 according to SEC filings Appcoin Innovations is slated to receive 20 percent of all KodakCoins issued and a portion of the offering proceeds a stake that could amount to millions if the offering is successfulOnce formally launched Mr Chell wrote to me in an email the company will hopefully provide shareholders a traditional and transparent place to participate in the crypto space with projects that are regulatory compliantNow about those coins You might think that a digital currency that is trying to democratize photography and make licensing fair to artists in Mr Clarkes words would be easily accessible But because of regulatory requirements KodakCoins will be available only to socalled accredited investors in the United States An accredited investor is defined as a person with a net worth of 1 million or more or an annual income above 200000How many cryptocurrencyobsessed millionaire photographers do you knowKodakCoins white paper says that token holders may receive other benefits such as a share of KodakOnes revenue and access to a marketplace that will allow them to spend their KodakCoins on camera equipment studios for photo shoots and travel expenses But these benefits could fail to materializeAll of this  the origins of KodakCoin the currency itself and the lofty claims about the KashMiners moneymaking potential  adds up to a big question mark and points to the possibility that Kodak may be in over its headThe bestcase scenario is that they believe that the technology will eventually be able to deliver what theyve pitched said Ms Carlson the blockchain consultant The worstcase scenario is that they are just being very opportunisticMr Clarke Kodaks chief executive characterized the blockchain projects as a small part of the companys overall strategy and said it was ironic that critics were faulting Kodak for embracing a young technology like cryptocurrency given that its past problems were caused by a failure to innovateThis isnt speculative Mr Clarke said Were taking an emerging new technology in blockchain and were using it to solve a real problemEmail Kevin Roose at

AdvertisementSupported byBERKELEY Calif  While the price of Bitcoin has dropped since Christmas the virtual currency boom has shown no signs of cooling off in the more august precincts of Americas elite universitiesSeveral top schools have added or are rushing to add classes about Bitcoin and the recordkeeping technology that it introduced known as the blockchainGraduatelevel classes this semester at Carnegie Mellon Cornell Duke the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Maryland among other places illustrate the fascination with the technology across several academic fields and the assumption that it will outlast the current speculative price bubbleThere was some gentle ribbing from my colleagues when I began giving talks on Bitcoin said David Yermack a business and law professor at New York University who offered one of the first forcredit courses on the topic back in 2014 But within a few months I was being invited to Basel to talk with central bankers and the joking from my colleagues stopped after thatFor a class this semester Mr Yermack originally booked a lecture hall that could fit 180 students but he had to move the course to the largest lecture hall at NYU when enrollment kept going up He now has 225 people signed up for the classA course about virtual currencies created by a Princeton computer science professor Arvind Narayanan has been the fifthmostpopular class on Coursera an online learning siteAnd last month at the University of California Berkeley students were lining the walls and sitting in the aisles for the first lecture of Blockchain Cryptoeconomics and the Future of Technology Business and LawThis is a very precious opportunity for you to be able to sit in this class Dawn Song a computer science professor told the students There are a bazillion other students who are waiting for your spotBecause developments in the field are moving so fast the business school professor also teaching the class Greg La Blanc said the students would have to forgive the teachers if they got things wrong on occasionWe arent waiting until we perfect it he said Dont compare it to the perfect blockchain course Compare it to having no blockchain course at allThe 75 spots in the Berkeley class were divided evenly among the law school the business school and the engineering department and faculty from the three departments are teaching the course together Ms Song said she had around 100 students vying for the 25 places set aside for her departmentThe interest is a fueled by the rising price of virtual currencies over the last year But they have created a host of issues that are worthy of study even apart from the price professors in a variety of fields saidFor lawyers virtual currency projects have challenged traditional legal categories and definitions of what constitutes a security or a commodityRegulators have been caught flatfooted as entrepreneurs have raised billions of dollars by selling virtual currencies without going through the traditional fundraising channels taking advantage of the legal fuzziness surrounding themFor economists and business school professors Bitcoin and other digital tokens have raised questions about the nature of money The first lecture in the Berkeley class for example considered the development of Bitcoin against the history of moneySeveral business school classes are also focusing on the decentralized methods of record keeping and decision making introduced by BitcoinBitcoin is given credit for creating the first blockchain a ledger of transactions that is updated by a network of computers without relying on any central company or governmentMany big companies are now looking at how blockchains independent of Bitcoin might be used to do things like track music royalties or cargo containers with input from the many parties involvedThe students in my class are from every possible discipline said Campbell Harvey a professor at Dukes business school who is teaching a class with 231 students this semester They understand that this is going to disrupt many different areas of business and they want to be the disrupters not the disrupteesThe computer scientists meanwhile are digging into the cryptography that virtual currencies use to secure their wallets and transaction data as well as the design of the distributed computer networks that make blockchains possibleLets assume that tomorrow the price of Bitcoin drops down to 2 said Nicolas Christin a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon who is teaching a course on Cryptocurrencies Blockchains and Applications this semester I still think its very cool from a technical standpointProfessors and students alike said that aside from the academic possibilities familiarity with blockchain technology was becoming much more useful on the job marketVinny Tuminelli a business school student sitting at the back of the Berkeley class said that during an internship at AnheuserBusch last summer the blockchain had come up in an innovation team he was on When he met with his supervisor more recently the topic came up againMy original understanding was that it was just thrown out there as a buzzword Mr Tuminelli said But now it seems like it has some legs behind it and people are putting real resources toward itStudents appear to have caught on to the opportunity faster than their professors Berkeley students have created a campus club that offers multiple courses on blockchain technology taught by the students themselvesThe director of MITs Digital Currency Initiative Neha Narula said that when it didnt schedule a course for this semester she got constant requests from students So she put one together and is now coteaching itStudents are just fascinated with this area she said They want to learn about it desperatelyAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,blockchain

AdvertisementSupported byOpEd ContributorsThe extraordinary rise in the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has led many people to worry that this market is a giant bubble Many including the Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen and the billionaire investor Warren Buffett have warned about a Bitcoin bust that could rival the dotcom crash of 2000 and wipe out speculatorsBut the bigger concern about cryptocurrencies may be the damage they could do in the long run to government finances through lost tax revenueThe core technology underlying cryptocurrencies known as blockchain is premised on anonymity Transactions are public but linked only to an electronic address This is a big part of what makes blockchain attractiveBut anonymity is also the main fuel for the underground economy which is now conducted largely via cash The underground economy is a significant source of lost tax revenue The Internal Revenue Service estimates that it loses around 500 billion annually because of unreported wages alone And the underground economy in the United States  estimated at 84 percent of output  is relatively small compared with those of other countriesIf cryptocurrencies were to replace cash as the preferred anonymous medium of exchange they could significantly expand the underground economy because they are so much more convenient than cash There is no need to visit an ATM and you can securely pay people regardless of their location No wonder Steven Mnuchin the Treasury secretary expressed concerns recently that Bitcoin could become the next Swiss bank accountThe IRS understands this which is why it has been pushing to break the anonymity of cryptocurrencies In November it persuaded a federal judge to order Coinbase a popular Bitcoin exchange to reveal the identity of the customers for more than 14000 accounts representing nearly nine million transactionsBlockchain technologies can also make it difficult for the IRS to tax cryptocurrency trading profits Here is a simple tax dodge that would be hard for the IRS to prove Suppose A B and C are electronic addresses you own You let the IRS know you own A but not B and C You buy one Bitcoin at 15000 and park it at A expecting the price to go up Just a few hours later when a Bitcoin is worth 15500 you send that Bitcoin to B and then to CA few months later when your Bitcoin is now worth 25000 you send it from C to A and tell the IRS I sold a Bitcoin to an anonymous counterparty at B back at 15500 and just now bought a Bitcoin from another anonymous counterparty at C for 25000 As a result you owe taxes on capital gains of just 500 rather than 10000The IRS can observe all the transactions between A B and C on the Bitcoin blockchain but it cannot disprove that B and C are arms length counterparties that is independent and not colluding Rules in the United States that require financial institutions to verify the identity of address holders do not solve the problem because as far as the IRS knows B and C could have been set up by a foreign institution that does not comply with such rulesIt is inconceivable that the government would simply accept enormous revenue losses from a larger underground economy and from tax dodges on trading profits The only question is how heavyhanded the response would beOne approach would be for the government to accept the difficulty of directly taxing cryptocurrency transactions and to offset the revenue losses by raising tax rates The basic economics of taxation tells us that the economic losses from taxes increase exponentially with the tax rate so this response would transform revenue losses into a lower gross domestic productMore likely the United States would take a tougher approach and attempt to ban cryptocurrencies This solution throws the baby out with the bath water While cryptocurrencies open opportunities for tax evasion and illegal operations they also offer drastic reductions in the cost of financial transactions especially for the poor and less reliance on banks which can increase the power of the Federal Reserve to control money supply and reduce the risk of bank runsA smarter response would be for the government to switch from taxing income when it is received to taxing income when it is spent Many economists support moving to this kind of consumption tax but it would require a major overhaul of the tax codeThe prospect of substantial government revenue losses is not just a problem for the United States government it is also a problem for the cryptocurrencies themselves For cryptocurrencies to survive long enough to be an effective means of performing everyday transactions the cryptocurrency community will need to find a way to prevent tax evasion This will involve a tricky balancing act preserving anonymity while providing the IRS with sufficient information to prevent tax evasionMore generally cracking down on tax evasion will require that the community learn to trust government Since this goes against the very ethos of the cryptocurrency movement it poses the most difficult  but no less necessary  challengeRichard Holden is a professor of economics at the

Europe to a trade warAdvertisementAdvertisementBut from that Mr Legere sought to change the way US wireless providers did business Lowering prices Ending some longterm contract requirements Offering unlimited data plansThe company took off like a rocketship and has sustained that momentum ever since the ATT merger was blocked the analyst Craig Moffett of the research firm MoffettNathanson told me in an interviewMore on the legacy of Mr Legere from my and Cecilias story on the dealThose policies helped TMobile add nearly 40 million customers over the last five years with 5 million new customers added last year alone ATT Verizon and Sprint all followed suit and in recent years the overall price of basic wireless plans has stayed flat or fallen according to Obamaera regulatorsThe Uncarrier campaign helped propel TMobile ahead of Sprint in 2015 As of Dec 31 the company had 587 million retail subscribers compared to Sprints 409 million TMobiles market value also outstripped that of Sprints contributing to the structure of Sundays deal Mr Legere would become CEO of the combined company which would keep the TMobile nameIn an ironic twist completion of the Sprint deal would put TMobile ahead of its former suitor ATT in terms of retail subscribers ATT had 932 million at the end of 2017But Mr Moffett said that the very success of Mr Legere and TMobile could pose problems for the Sprint deal since it proves that regulators opposition to the two companies effort to merge in 2014 was justifiedWhen I asked about the tweet in a phone interview on Sunday  which also involved Marcelo Claure Sprints CEO  Mr Legere chuckled Youre expecting me to remember tweets from 2014 he responded Michael de la MercedThe 5G aspects that are critical for the country and critical for us

mergers many antitrust staffers at the Justice Department are the same people who opposed the deal in 2014No matter how much hyperbole Sprint and TMobile expend it is hard to see how the deal will pass muster with regulatorsIt would not surprise me if they can come up with an economist with a model that says this is all unicorns and cupcakes said Michael Kades a former lawyer at the FTC who is

Demos and Emily Glazer of the WSJThe financial companies have explored creating a new creditcard code for firearms dealers similar to how they code restaurants or department stores according to people familiar with the matter Another idea would require merchants to share information about specific firearm products consumers are buying some of the people saidIf the credit card companies and banks agreed they could come up with a series of subcodes that would identify retailers that sold guns under a best practices policy  like the policy that Citigroup proposed or the one that Walmart and Dicks follow  and the ones that dont It would add transparency to the process and it would give banks that issue credit cards the opportunity to decide which retailers they wanted to associate withBut such a move might concern opponents of gun control who worry that keeping tabs on firearms sales would be contrary to the governments handsoff approach to monitoring such transactions And then there

currency marketsNo the subject of this gloomy affair was taxes Specifically how  and whether  to pay themIve lost sleep over it said Shaun a trader who said he was still figuring out how to properly account for last years cryptocurrency profits on his taxes Shaun who asked that his last name not be used because he has been audited in the past said he was scared that increased scrutiny of the cryptocurrency market could lead the IRS to pay special attention to cases like hisI dont want to be made an example of he saidThis gathering which took place last week in Manhattan and was organized by Blockmatics a research and education company featured three accountants who specialize in cryptocurrency tax preparation For an hour the audience peppered them with taxprep questions that ranged from common Do I have to pay taxes on Bitcoin if I havent sold yet to esoteric If my Bitcoin wallet got hacked and all my coins got stolen can I deduct my losses By the end of the hour there seemed to be many more questions than answersFor answers to some common questions about cryptocurrencies and taxes see my colleague Tara Siegel Bernards column on the topicIts complicated as heck said Mike Schreibman an IT consultant who attended Mr Schreibman pulled out his phone to show me a dashboard of all the cryptocurrencies he trades and said that he was considering filing an extension to buy himself more time for analysisNobody knows whats going to happen said Jeanne Lowdermilk a lawyer who trades cryptocurrencies But the IRS is the one agency you dont want to mess withTaxes have become an increasingly divisive topic among cryptocurrency fans On Reddit forums devoted to cryptocurrency trading some users exchange tips for dodging their tax obligations including a method of hiding their assets by converting them into privacy coins such as Monero which are designed to be opaque and untraceable They argue about whether the IRS could use the blockchain the digital ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions to identify tax evaders in the future And they ask for tax advice on complex situations such as flybynight cryptocurrency exchanges that vanish suddenly erasing the records of users transactionsCryptocurrencies are taxunfriendly by design Many of the early adopters of Bitcoin were libertarians and anarchists who were drawn to the technologys stateless decentralized nature And while cryptocurrency transactions are permanently recorded on the blockchain its possible for users to conceal their identitiesAll of this confusion has created a cottage industry of specialized accountants who can keep traders out of tax trouble Many of these accountants are cryptocurrency fans themselves and they are more likely than your average CPA to understand concepts like airdrops hard forks and other bits of confusing cryptojargonMario Costanz the chief executive of the tax preparation firm Happy Tax told me that an influx of cryptocurrency trading clients had helped his business more than triple in the past year Last year Happy Tax opened a separate cryptocurrency division Crypto Tax Prep which already has several thousand clients and is the fastestgrowing segment of his businessWere preparing for a pretty insane last seven to 10 days of the tax season Mr Costanz saidLaura Walter a Tokyo accountant who goes by Crypto Tax Girl on Twitter said she had been inundated with requests for help with tax preparation this yearA lot of crypto investors are younger and dont have a lot of experience trading stocks she said When they find out they owe taxes on their cryptocurrency trades she said a lot of people are kind of shockedPart of what makes paying cryptocurrency taxes so difficult is that current IRS rules treat cryptocurrency as property rather than currency That means that every time you sell or transfer a digital coin for something else  whether youre cashing out Ether for dollars trading Bitcoin for another cryptocurrency or using Ripple to buy a cup of coffee  youre creating a taxable event that must be separately recorded and accounted forComplicating matters even more the timing of last years cryptocurrency boom made for some extra tax headaches The price of Bitcoin rose more than 1500 percent last year with most of the gains coming during the last two months of the year High prices caused many traders to sell Bitcoin in 2017 in order to lock in their profits But instead of cashing out into dollars many traders put their 2017 profits into new cryptocurrency investments most of which have lost money in this years market slump That decline has left some investors short of the funds they need to pay the taxes they owe on last years gainsMs Walter said she had seen clients with cryptocurrency gains as large as 400000 who did not withhold taxes during the year and subsequently lost money trading Now theyre stuck with these huge tax bills and they dont have the capital to pay itEven the people at the cryptocurrency tax event in Manhattan admitted that most of the traders they knew werent planning to pay taxes on their cryptogainsThis is the smallest crypto event Ive been to said Mr Schreibman the

career at T Rowe Price and became the chief investment officer I would go hang out down at the trading desk and draw on the walls My parents got married when they were still in college so my mother did not graduate right away She had kids but then went back to college at Johns Hopkins Then when I was 9 she decided to go to law school and actually became the first woman partner in her law firm So I got to see her really transform from being this awesome stayathome mom to being a combination of a great mom and a great career person and my dad was really really supportive of what she was doing It was a formative thing for me to see how she transformed herselfIt was a really important part of me growing up being in an environment where being smart was celebrated They constantly talked about going as far as you can go in your life I wanted to be an astronaut when I grew up and our science teacher  who was a man  said OK well lets work that out Here are some things you can think about in terms of learning physics Look at this great space camp you can go to It was not at all like Oh thats hard It was more like Great lets get you well positioned to be able to do thatDid you always want to get into financeI really wanted to do political science I worked on a congressional campaign one summer and then worked on Capitol Hill for a summer It was somewhat of a disillusioning experience realizing how policy really gets made You kind of walk in with this idealistic view of Of course your congressmans going to represent all of your interests I came away saying Wow progress is slowWhat drew you to Wall StreetIn business school I really liked product management As a product manager you have to own the four Ps of marketing  product placement pricing and promotion If you own the product its like being the CEO of your own little company I didnt think that I would be that excited to do that for consumer goods but I would love to be able to do that for financial products So I went to NasdaqYou joined Nasdaq in 1993 What was it like being a woman on Wall Street back then There were not a lot of women in the office But the man I worked for saw me as someone who was an MBA grad He would give me something to do and I would go do it and I would do it well He never once made me feel at all different or disadvantaged by being a woman I just got stuff doneWhen I got my first promotion I was actually pregnant For him it was like Oh thats fine Youll be gone for three months and youll come back He really just didnt even factor it into his decision makingWhat advice do you give to women who feel like they arent receiving equal treatmentFirst of all make sure you have a voice I had this one woman that worked for me and every time she had an idea she would whisper it into the room So I took her aside and I said Speak up You are really really smart No more mousy voice Get in the room and speak at the same tone as everyone else and I can assure you your voice will be heardNext time she had an opinion she spoke up and everyone was like Wow thats a really good idea Then she was empowered to do it again and again And still some women may face discrimination What then If you really dont feel youre getting the opportunities that you should be getting maybe you should look for a different place to work or a different person to work for Then of course if you really feel like youre not being treated properly as a person there should be many means for women to be able to voice that concern to HR to legalWhen you rejoined Nasdaq after a stint at the Carlyle Group you went from being a CFO to being the CEO Was that a difficult transition The CFO role is actually the hardest role in the company One minute youre having to manage risk and the next minute youre having to advise your CEO on how to take risk What I found frustrating about the CFO role is youre not the ultimate decision maker I prefer to be the risk takerMost people know Nasdaq as the stock exchange where Facebook and Tesla trade but thats a small part of the business What is Nasdaq today We are a great capital market ourselves But we also provide technology to 96 other markets around the world We are kind of the technology that powers the capital markets around the world todayAre you going to allow initial coin offerings on NasdaqYou have to look at the blockchain and cryptocurrencies as two distinct concepts two totally different things The blockchain as a technology has the opportunity to create a lot more efficiency in the capital markets You can create a perfect record of ownership and the transfer of ownership I think that the SEC is taking the right actions to scrutinize in great detail the concept of an ICO ICOs as constructed today outside the construct of a regulatory framework  thats not something were getting involved in Whats your leadership style We have this process we call the light bulb versus the mandate When were in a room and we

or ICE the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange mark a dramatic shift toward the mainstream for a digital token that has been known primarily for its underworld associations and status as a highrisk speculative investmentThe new interest among Wall Street power brokers also represents a surprising new chapter in the renegade history of BitcoinThe virtual currency was created after the 2008 global financial crisis by a stillanonymous programmer who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto The idea was to replace the existing banking structure with an online alternative that couldnt be controlled by a handful of powerful organizationsBut instead of being replaced the old banks are beginning to assert their own role in the unorthodox financial world of virtual currency sometimes called cryptocurrenciesWhile Bitcoin was originally intended to be used by consumers for all sorts of transactions  without any financial institutions getting involved  it has mostly become a virtual investment stored in digital wallets and traded on mostly unregulated exchanges around the world People buy Bitcoin in the hope that its value will go up similar to the way they purchase gold or silverDetails of the platform that Intercontinental Exchange is working on have not been finalized and the project could still fall apart given the hesitancy among big Wall Street institutions to be closely associated with the Wild West of virtual currencies A spokesman said that the company had no commentSome large financial exchanges including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have already created financial products linked to the price of Bitcoin known as futures But the new operation at ICE would provide more direct access to Bitcoin by putting the actual tokens in the customers account at the end of the tradeICE has had conversations with other financial institutions about setting up a new operation through which banks can buy a contract known as a swap that will end with the customer owning Bitcoin the next day  with the backing and security of the exchange according to the people familiar with the projectThe swap contract is more complicated than an immediate trade of dollars for Bitcoin even if the end result is still ownership of a certain amount of Bitcoin But a swap contract allows the trading to come under the regulation of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and to operate clearly under existing laws  something todays Bitcoin exchanges have struggled to doThe reason we got into crypto was not to partner with a bank but to replace them Mr Chou said using the shorthand for cryptocurrencies We deal with crypto holders directly in a way that really takes advantage of Bitcoins strengths while avoiding brokers banks and other institutions that take multiple cuts of the transactionGoldman will initially only be trading futures contracts linked to Bitcoins price But Goldman executives said they were looking at moving in the direction of buying and selling actual BitcoinsIntercontinental Exchanges effort if it pans out could make Bitcoin available to a much wider and more influential customer base including other financial firmsSeveral big corporate names including the giant technology investor SoftBank which has stakes in Sprint and Uber have been in discussions about being involved with the exchange in some way the people familiar with the project said But a spokesman for SoftBank said this week that it was no longer involvedLedgerX the exchange founded by Mr Chou is the only exchange that now offers the kind of swaps that ICE has discussed LedgerX has experienced increasing trading volume in recent months but ICE would start with an edge because essentially every large financial institution is already hooked into itThe interest in Bitcoin trading illustrates how the reputation of the virtual currency has after a rocky start improvedICE was considering launching a swap contract linked to Ether but backed away from that because of regulatory uncertainty the people briefed on the effort saidMr Chou at LedgerX said he made a similar decision and has delayed creating any products linked to EtherWith Bitcoin on the other hand Mr Chou said that road seems to be clear for big institutions to get involvedThe industry is seeing unprecedented institutional interest for the first time in Bitcoins history he said Ive been amazed that the strongest believers in cryptocurrency often start out the most skeptical Its a healthy skepticism But at some point the perception shifts and for many institutions  I think were finally thereAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,blockchain

AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO  Russian and Venezuelan officials are hoping virtual currencies can help their countries make an end run around American sanctionsBoth governments with ambitions to create statesponsored cryptocurrencies are looking to take advantage of the promise that Bitcoin introduced to the world financial system a new kind of money and financial infrastructure outside the control of any central authority particularly the United StatesThe Russian and Venezuelan plans may sound outlandish even in the financial Wild West of Bitcoin and its online competitors But they underscore how the rise of virtual currencies is pushing governments around the world to rethink the most basic elements of their own currencies and financial infrastructureIn Venezuela the idea has come from the top President Nicols Maduro laid out a plan last month to create a homegrown digital currency known as the Petro which would be similar to Bitcoin but backed by the governments oil and natural resourcesIn Russia officials under President Vladimir V Putin have floated the idea of a Bitcoinlike crypto rubleEconomists and virtual currency experts have given Venezuelas Petro and the crypto ruble from Russia low probabilities of working in the way the governments seem to anticipate Thats because Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are decentralized systems with no one in charge while the Russian and Venezuelan plans would give the leaders of both countries a measure of control over the new currenciesThat runs counter to some of the most basic concepts of virtual currencyAll Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a ledger known as the blockchain which is maintained by many independent computers The system was designed that way explicitly to avoid central banks and large financial institutions Just as email allowed messages to move around without going through a central postal service the computer network maintaining Bitcoin records allows money to move around without going through any central authorityThat would provide a good way to get around sanctions which are usually enforced through regulatory and banking disclosure rulesBut some central bankers have said that issuing their own currencies on some sort of blockchain could make it easier for citizens to use the money without going through intermediaries like banks and credit card companies It could also make the records more resistant to tampering and hackingThe prototype works he addedThese projects though have been slow to move from prototype to working systems and many officials and programmers have pointed to many technical hurdles that still need to be overcomeNone of that has stopped Venezuela from moving forward quickly with its effort to create a digital asset that the government can controlMr Maduro introduced the idea on Dec 3 in his regular Sunday television program He said he had been monitoring socalled cryptocurrencies and had put in place plans to create the Petro which would be backed by the countrys gold oil gas and diamond reservesTo overcome the financial blockade this will allow us to move toward new forms of international financing he saidSince then the government has created an office of the cryptocurrency superintendent and appointed officials to run the operationThe Petros are set to live on a blockchain like the one Bitcoin uses but will derive their value from the governments natural resourcesThe link between Petros and natural resources could be similar to the backing that gold provided for most international currencies a century ago The backing might counteract the sort of hyperinflation that the real Venezuelan currency the bolvar has experienced in recent years because of the governments unbridled expansion of the money supplyThe country is in a social crisis said Jos ngel lvarez the head of a national association Asonacrip that has been working with the government on the Petro How do we manage to build trust Open technology clear rules that meet the attributes of the cryptocoin decentralization for exampleMr lvarez said he anticipated that the first oil will be sold for Petros in the first half of 2018But the link between the currency and the governments oil holdings is likely to make it unattractive to investors given the lack of confidence that investors have shown in Mr Maduross governmentThere is a measure of irony in the governments interest in cryptocurrencies Over the last few years Venezuelans have shown a growing interest in virtual currencies as a means of escaping Mr Maduros governmentAn online marketplace known as LocalBitcoins has connected Venezuelans looking to buy Bitcoin and get their money out of the bolvar which has steadily lost value because of hyperinflation This year the number of transactions in Venezuela on LocalBitcoins has risen tenfold according to Chainalysis a data analysis firmThe Venezuelan government has not been nearly as welcoming of this type of virtual currency activityRandy Brito the founder of the Facebook group Bitcoin Venezuela said that in December he identified between 10 and 20 cases where people in Venezuela appeared to have been arrested for their Bitcoin activities  more than double the cases he had seen in the year up until nowIn most cases buying any sort of foreign currency is illegal in Venezuela That prevents residents from sending all of their money out of the countryMr Brito who left Venezuela in 2004 and now lives in Spain said everyone in his group was aware of how the government was punishing its citizens for doing the same thing that the government was trying to do within the broader financial systemThe irony is in front of us he said They have been blockaded by the US just like they blockade their own people from operatingFirst and foremost this is an opportunity for laundering illegal gains tax evasion and even financing of terrorism not to mention the proliferation of scams to which ordinary people can fall victim he said in OctoberThe efforts in Russia are much less urgent than those in Venezuela because the Russian economy is doing much better But leaders there have been looking widely for any way to push back against American sanctionsSuch a currency would make it easier for the government to track and tax transactions which is an advantage that other countries have spoken about as wellBut he said at the time these are adaptable actors who are drawn to ungoverned spaces and so may increasingly look to this technology as an attractive way to transfer valueNathaniel Popper reported from San

AdvertisementSupported byThe clear idea behind the suggestion  which Mr Trump is also said to be weighing  is that ousting Mr Rosenstein would enable the White House to put the criminal investigations encircling the presidents associates on a tighter leash or even to shut them downHere is a look at some of the issues at stakeA longtime Justice Department official Mr Rosenstein was not part of Mr Trumps inner circle before Attorney General Jeff Sessions persuaded the president to designate him as deputyAfter Mr Sessions recused himself from investigations related to the 2016 election Mr Rosenstein became acting attorney general for those matters He appointed Robert S Mueller III the special counsel to scrutinize ties between the Trump campaign and Russias interference in the election He signed off as Mr Muellers focus expanded to whether Mr Trump committed obstruction of justice and whether Mr Trumps onetime campaign manager Paul Manafort committed crimes related to his work for Ukraines proRussian government Mr Rosenstein also approved the decision to get search warrants for Mr Cohens filesMr Trump has bitterly denounced Mr Sessionss recusal saying he needs an attorney general who will protect himMr Rosenstein could have expanded Mr Muellers jurisdiction to include that matter but instead he apparently handed it to a different office As a result there is now a separate prosecutorial team that has seen evidence about matters close to the president that it  and the federal magistrate judge who issued the search warrant  found worth investigatingHowever the impression created by that article appears to have been somewhat overstated Mr Schneiderman has no clear jurisdiction to file charges in some of the potential crimes at issue in the core Justice Department investigations like federal election law offenses Law enforcement officials familiar with the talks cautioned that neither side was routinely sharing investigative materialsIt might make it easier to constrain the investigations or even to fire Mr Mueller  and now perhaps Mr Khuzami too Mr Rosenstein has said he will refuse any order to fire Mr Mueller if he did not believe the special counsel committed misconduct citing a Justice Department regulation that says such a prosecutor may be removed only by the attorney general and only for good causeA successor who is more of a loyalist to Mr Trump might be more amenable to interpreting Mr Muellers jurisdiction narrowly or to firing him either by declaring that Mr Mueller has overstepped or by removing the regulation that protects him from arbitrary removalNo In and of itself the removal of Mr Rosenstein  or Mr Mueller and Mr Khuzami  would not stop the law enforcement officials working for them from continuing to pursue those casesBen Protess contributed reporting from New YorkAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,blockchain

The outdoor retailer has supported grassroots environmental activists for decades Now it is suing the president in a bid to protect Bears Ears National MonumentSupported byVENTURA Calif  The offices of Patagonia occupy a lowslung complex of stucco buildings in this sleepy beachside town in Southern California There are solar panels and picnic tables in the parking lot day care with a jungle gym by the main lobby and easy access to the beach where employees surf during lunch break It is a corporate Eden of sorts where idealistic Californians run a privately held company that sells about 1 billion of puffy down jackets and organic cotton jeans each yearBut on an unseasonably hot and windy Monday morning in early December Patagonia headquarters were transformed into something that quickly resembled a war room There were emergency conference calls with Washington lawyers Court filings were prepared Web designers remade the companys home pageIt wasnt a business crisis that had mobilized the company however It was politicsMr Trump said the decision was about reducing federal overreach Some people think that the natural resources of Utah should be controlled by a small handful of very distant bureaucrats located in Washington he said And guess what Theyre wrongYet to the tribal groups and conservationists who had been monitoring the situation including Patagonia the decision realized some of their worst fears that the Trump administration would be waging an assault on public lands and potentially opening up protected areas to drilling and miningPatagonia was as ready for this moment as any company could be For more than 45 years the company has mixed business and politics to a degree unusual in corporate America While companies are expected to weigh in on everything from gun control to transgender rights these days  and many do so uncomfortably  Patagonia has been unapologetically political since the 1970sIt bills itself the Activist Company and publicly advocates for environmental protection fair trade and stricter labor standards It supports thousands of grassroots environmental activists and has been involved with Bears Ears since 2012 But until December Patagonia had never tangled with a presidentThat Monday morning about 50 Patagonia employees gathered in a conference room to watch Mr Trumps speech The mood was somber Then within an hour of the presidents remarks Patagonia updated the home page of its website Instead of promotional images advertising colorful products there was a stark message against a black background The President Stole Your LandAt the same time Patagonias legal team set into motion a plan that had been in the works for months It would sue the presidentWorking with a handful of local groups and the law firm Hogan Lovells Patagonia filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Washington The lawsuit named as defendants Mr Trump Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke the secretary of agriculture the director of the Bureau of Land Management and the chief of the Forest Service And the argument was simple The Antiquities Act of 1906 gave presidents the power to create national monuments But it did not grant the power to reduce themFor as much authority as it gave to the president to create these monuments Congress gave the president no authority to revoke or modify those monuments the lawsuit reads Congress is the sole authority that can undertake such changesThe barbs only stiffened Patagonias resolve The companys founder went on CNN and called the Trump administration evil And Rose Marcario Patagonias chief executive officer made the protection of Bears Ears one of her top prioritiesWeve always given to grassroots organizations its part of our DNA she said in a recent interview at company headquarters an American flag flying outside her window But the fight got a lot more urgent after the election This was totally unheardofIt would have been enough for one day if Patagonia had just been caught up in a public spat with the president But hours after Mr Trumps announcement a more urgent crisis emerged A brush fire was reported in Santa Paula Calif a small community not far from Patagonias headquartersThe hot dry Santa Ana winds blowing that day whipped the fire into an inferno and much of Ventura was soon evacuated At the very moment Patagonia was preparing to sue the president its campus was shut down indefinitely and employees fled their homesWe did a lot of scenario planning for the lawsuit said Corley Kenna Patagonias head of communications We didnt put on the list that lifethreatening fires would be happening at the same timePatagonia was founded by Yvon Chouinard an enigmatic mountain climber with an interest in Zen Buddhism and a passion for the environment In 1957 he taught himself to blacksmith and began making and selling climbing gear that was less damaging to the rocks he and his buddies were scaling in Yosemite National ParkWithin a few years he had set up shop in Ventura and was doing a brisk business selling clothing for outdoor enthusiasts He eventually called the company Patagonia a homage to the vast mountainous region at the southern tip of South America where he had recently traveledPatagonia developed a cult following and expanded its offerings But for the most part the company was a means to an end a source of funds that enabled Mr Chouinard and his friends to surf climb and travel their way around the worldThat changed in 1972 when Mr Chouinard attended a City Council meeting to hear about development plans along the Ventura River Under a proposal being considered the flow of the river would have been changed and a prized surf break could have been ruinedAt the meeting it looked as if the development would proceed Then a young environmental activist Mark Capelli took the floor He presented a slide show and argued that the proposed changes would harm the birds water snakes and muskrats in the estuary The development was halted the river was protected and the surf break was preservedMr Chouinard befriended Mr Capelli and began to support his work giving free office space to his nascent organization Friends of the Ventura River and helping to fend off several more attempts to develop the riverThat set the template Patagonia would offer small grants to local activists give inkind support through marketing knowhow and business savvy and amplify their message with customers Mr Chouniard also resolved to give one percent of Patagonias sales to support environmental activismPatagonia has established a unique role in the political and policy ecosystem and are willing to be very public about their advocacy said Neil Kornze who was a director of the Bureau of Land Management under President Barack Obama and now runs an environmental consulting firm They are a group of avid environmentalists who just happen to sell coatsBusiness is booming under Ms Marcario A former private equity executive who walked away from finance to study Buddhist meditation in India for two years Ms Marcario joined Patagonia in 2008 as chief financial officer drawn to the companys environmental activismThats why Im not on Wall Street right now making a ton of money she said Im kind of worried about the planetShe was named chief executive in 2014 and has overseen Patagonias continued expansion Revenues and profits have quadrupled over the past 10 years according to the companyAnd the company maintains a team of 18 people focused on supporting activism and distributing grants Since 1985 Patagonia has given away some 90 million to environmental causesScience without activism is dead science Mr Chouinard said in a recent interview We want to fund the little activist organizations that are out there on the front lines the grandmothers in front of the bulldozersIn 2012 one of the little activist organizations that Patagonia supported for the first time was Friends of Cedar Mesa a small nonprofit organization advocating for the protection of a wide swath of sensitive desert in southern Utah including the area that would become Bears EarsAt the time Republicans in Utah notably Representative Rob Bishop were intensifying efforts to reduce federal protections of some lands in the state Doing so could open the door for more oil and gas drilling and uranium mining bringing in additional state tax revenuePatagonia has been interested in this area for a long time Mr Ewing said More than any company Ive ever seen they put their money where their mouth isAs Patagonia learned more about Bears Ears which was a favorite of rock climbers it came to appreciate the areas significance Sacred land to tribal groups and home to Hopi and Navajo ruins and petroglyphs carved into rock walls it was a largely unspoiled terrain that could be threatened by expanded drilling and miningAs we got more involved we recognized the cultural and spiritual importance of the place said Lisa Pike Sheehy Patagonias vice president of environmental activism This was a place that should have been protected 50 years agoIn total Patagonia has spent some 2 million on efforts to protect Bears Ears including making grants to nonprofit groups producing films and other marketing materials and buying television ads And at least for a brief moment they workedWe never got the chance to celebrate the monument being created Mr Ewing said The writing was on the wall There wasnt ever a moment when we thought the monument was safeInside Patagonia Ms Marcario and her staff knew their resolve would soon be tested On the morning after Mr Trumps election Ms Marcario sent out an allstaff email Defending our air soil and water has never been more important she wrote In the last few years our voice and reach has grown louder and stronger  we wont stopDuring a monthslong public comment period the Interior Department received more than two million submissions the majority of them supporting the continued protection of public lands Patagonia said its customers had submitted more than 150000 commentsDuring the first months of the new administration Ms Marcario and another Patagonia employee Hans Cole made numerous attempts to meet with Mr Zinke as part of outdoor industry delegations according to internal Interior Department emails reviewed by The Times No meeting with Mr Zinke ever took place but Mr Cole joined two meetings with Interior Department staffAround this time Patagonia also began planning for its eventual lawsuit It enlisted Hogan Lovells which tracked developments on the issue and organized a weekly conference call for the eventual plaintiffsThe retailers added an economic argument to the campaign to protect Bears Ears Outdoor recreation contributes more than 12 billion annually to the Utah economy spending that could be jeopardized if public lands are developedThat evening Ms Marcario was driving north along the California coast returning home from a business trip As she approached Patagonias headquarters she could see flames encircling VenturaI saw the whole ridge line on fire she said I realized we wouldnt be able to go back to the officePatagonia enacted its emergency plan overnight Employees were instructed to stay away from campus and the company offered to pay for accommodations for anyone who had to evacuateA skeleton crew stayed behind at Patagonia putting out spot fires as they flared up on campus The fire spread surrounding Ventura and consuming hospitals and apartment buildings on the outskirts of townThere was ash falling like rain Ms Marcario said It was something I have never seen beforeMr Zinke hit back You mean Patagonia made in China he said on a press call accusing the company of playing politics in a gambit to sell more clothes I think its shameful and appalling that they would blatantly lie in order to gain money in their coffersThen on Fox Business Network Mr Zinke took issue with Patagonias activism They should focus on how to bring manufacturing back to this country rather than lying to the public about losing federal land he saidAs Patagonia and Trump supporters traded barbs the blaze known as the Thomas Fire became the largest wildfire in modern California history Burning for more than a month it destroyed more than 1000 structures and forced the evacuation of some 100000 people Downtown Ventura and the Patagonia campus were spared but five employees lost their homesWith the fire still burning out of control on Dec 6 Ms Marcario was working from her home in Montecito 30 minutes north of headquarters Friends and employees who had fled were staying with her though Ms Marcario would later be forced to evacuate tooThen in the middle of what felt like the apocalypse across my inbox comes an email she said Patagonia versus Donald Trump et alMs Marcario placed a call to her executive team and informed it that she had approved the lawsuit Patagonia was suing the presidentSince that week in December the feud between Patagonia and the Trump administration has continued to simmerThe decision was nothing more than a political favor Ms Sheehy the companys vice president of environmental activism wrote in a blog post The redrawing of boundaries was deliberate and directly influenced by an industry that spends millions of dollars lobbying the government to get what it wantsThe Trump administration has not formally responded to the lawsuit filed by Patagonia and the other plaintiffs Heather Swift a spokeswoman for the Interior Department said in an email that claims that the redrawing of boundaries was motivated by oil and gas interests were patently and demonstrably falseMs Marcario draws a link between the extraction and consumption of fossil fuels and the Thomas Fire which some climate scientists believe was made worse by climate changeThese are climate disasters and theyre going to get worse and worse Ms Marcario said We have an administration that isnt paying any attention to thatPatagonias lawsuit against Mr Trump is currently tied up in the courts It has been consolidated with two other cases filed by separate groups and the government has asked a judge in Washington to transfer the case to Utah There is no deadline for that decision and until then all proceedings in the case are stayed Hogan Lovells which has 25 lawyers working the case on a pro bono basis has billed 17 million in hours to dateIn the meantime the area originally protected by Bears Ears National Monument is available for commercial use including drilling and mining though there hasnt yet been any new developmentAt Patagonia Ms Sheehy said that while the company would see its suit against the president through to the end it had an expansive time horizon when it came to environmental protectionThese are all long fights she said Were in this for 50 years 100 yearsAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,business

Sprint that was planning to acquire TMobileThat deal fell apart in the face of regulatory scrutiny And since then Mr Legere has managed to build TMobiles business by flouting convention Under his leadership TMobile began offering unlimited data reduced prices and less stringent contract commitmentsWhen Mr Legere took over in 2012 he was a very different executive and TMobile was a very different companyTMobile was reeling from a failed attempt to sell itself to ATT and struggling to distinguish itself from other lowcost carriers like Sprint and Metro PCS Mr Legere who spent 20 years working at ATT was a conventional if ambitious telecommunications executiveHe was a finance guy said Dan Hesse the former chief executive of Sprint who was a mentor of Mr Legeres at ATT The first time I saw John after he was named CEO of TMobile he was there in his suitThat soon changed In 2013 Mr Legere was onstage at an event in Las Vegas with Joe Torre the former manager of the Yankees promoting a partnership between TMobile and Major League BaseballWhen reporters asked him about the state of the wireless industry he responded with a tirade about how badly customers were mistreated and what he planned to do differentlySoon Mr Legere now 59 had a whole new look He grew his hair to his shoulders He wore company Tshirts wherever he went He pulled on custom pink Converse sneakers emblazoned with the TMobile logo Before long the finance guy looked more like an aging rock starAnd on Twitter he began hurling insults at competitors and tangling with rival CEOs  including Sprints Marcelo ClaureOffline Mr Legere also cultivated an eccentric image He is a regular visitor to TMobile stores and call centers where he delivers boisterous pep talks At company meetings he offers employees 100 if they will ask him a question in the form of a song And in the office he is fond of riding around on a SegwayJohn has built a franchise around TMobile which is in part his own said Stephen Scherr head of the consumer and commercial banking division at Goldman Sachs who has worked with Mr Legere for more than a decadeBut Mr Legere has paired showmanship with results During his tenure TMobile has added subscribers and increased revenues and profits Hes also a great operator Mr Scherr said He runs a really good businessIf Mr Legere succeeds in finally joining TMobile and Sprint the man who wanted to come off as the consummate outsider will have pulled off the ultimate insider move a megamerger to combine two rival companies and seize a greater share of a changing industryUnder President Trump antitrust enforcement has become unpredictable The Justice Department has mounted a court fight against the proposed combination of ATT and Time Warner which do not directly compete with each other At the same time there appears to be little resistance to the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets by Disney a deal which would reduce competition in the film and television industryMr Legere who is sensitive to public perceptions seems to have anticipated this moment In January 2017 after Mr Trumps election but before his inauguration Mr Legere was asked about his view of the regulatory environment under the Trump administrationIts hard not to be excited he said about regulatory views that would be conducive to us significantly expanding our businessMr Legere knew from firsthand experience In 2015 after Mr Trump insulted the UFC fighter Ronda Rousey on Twitter Mr Legere came to her defense In the ensuing exchange Mr Legere said Mr Trump wasnt presidential materialI am an undecided Republican Mr Legere wrote Well not totally undecided I know what I dont want But it seems that the prospect of a multibilliondollar deal can heal old woundsMr Legere has since deleted that tweet about the president And on Sunday Mr Legere was making the rounds with Mr Claure of Sprint another old social media sparring partner to talk up their allianceAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,business

restaurants and trafficchoked streets The capital city seemed to be bustlingBut more than five months after Hurricane Maria plowed through Puerto Rico some parts of the island are still in the dark It is a long long way from being back in businessEverywhere you look there are reminders of how long it will take for the economy to get back even to the beleaguered state it was in on Sept 20 when Maria hit as a powerful Category 4 stormGovernment relief workers have installed 57000 blue tarps as makeshift roofs on damaged homes across the island Theres no plan for installing permanent roofsMajor intersections in San Juan still lack working traffic lightsMore than 10000 small businesses  nearly 20 percent of the islands total  remain closed At the upscale Mall of San Juan two anchor stores  Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom  are shut because of storm damage although Nordstrom may reopen in a few monthsSome hotel workers cabdrivers and bartenders in San Juan have been living without power since SeptemberThe most optimistic estimate is that Puerto Rico faces a twoyear economic recovery That assumes it can rebuild its power grid restructure its finances in a courtsupervised process and not get hit by another devastating stormThis is like the perfect storm of an economic disaster said Javier E ZapataRodrguez deputy director of economic development for PathStone Enterprise Center which advises small businesses in Puerto Rico There is not enough capital flowing and a lot of small businesses are closing up shop because they were ailing before the hurricaneA major problem is that insurance claims are being paid too slowly and 60 percent of household requests for federal emergency grants are being denied That means fewer dollars are churning through the local economy when not much money is coming in from elsewhereTourism which accounts for about 6 percent of the islands economy and supports more than 60000 jobs is all but gone for this seasonNearly a dozen big resorts in and around San Juan  including El Conquistador the Caribe Hilton the Ritz Carlton and El San Juan  are closed Many hotels that are open are filled not with tourists but with relief workers and government contractors who are staying at discounted ratesAn electronic sign outside the Condado Plaza Hilton owned by the Blackstone Group the private equity firm periodically flashes Rooms for relief work and government work available Blackstone which also owns El Conquistador said it had been paying salaries and providing health benefits to hundreds of furloughed workersOthers associated with the tourism business are just scraping byAs many as 200000 residents have left to live on the mainland Some companies that are trying to reopen are struggling to find people who can work on construction projects or in factories to produce steelThe storm laid waste to those plansIn Ponce a city on Puerto Ricos southern coast PathStone is helping 200 small businesses get financing find workers and retrain them if necessaryA few weeks ago PathStone in partnership with the New York Fed staged a daylong event for small businesses seeking financing from banks and other lenders Representatives from 170 businesses showed up in search of help Mr ZapataRodrguez said About a third of the companies that PathStone works with in Puerto Rico do not have reliable electrical power he addedThe fragility of the power grid remains particularly frustrating On Thursday hundreds of thousand of customers  many in San Juan and along the islands northern coast  lost power in the middle of the workday Generators considered optional before Maria are now a necessity Starbucks is moving to ensure that most of its 26 stores in Puerto Rico two of which are still closed have generatorsThe power failure interrupted a meeting that David Rodriguez was having in Caguas to discuss plans for a new business involving the sale of solarpowered generatorsMr Rodriguez who was born in Puerto Rico and runs a telecommunications engineering firm in Rochester NY returned to the island in December to visit family He was alarmed to find his uncle living with a gasolinepowered generator running inside the house  a serious health risk His uncle said he was keeping the generator indoors because he was afraid it might be stolen if it was outsideWe want to get some basic humanity back Mr Rodriguez saidOne challenge however has been finding an undamaged location that can be quickly converted into a factory He is working with PathStone to hire former farmworkers who have experience using heavy equipmentThe search for qualified workers is troubling a broad swath of businessesFrankie Vazquez Marrero runs a business that sells precast walls and structured steel He employed 22

construction industry is growingBillions of dollars from Washington are starting to flow for rebuilding the electrical grid and for housing and urban development projects But the package is well short of the tens of billions that experts have said are neededAnd insurance money is just trickling in So far 299999 claims have been filed by homeowners and businesses but just 17 billion in payouts have been approved according to the insurance departmentMuch of the federal money is being dispensed as grants and loans that businesses and individuals apply for from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration among others The typical household FEMA grant is a few thousand dollarsLawyers and community groups complain that FEMA has rejected about 60 percent of the 11 million household applications it has received The agency said that figure was misleading because some rejected applicants had received loans from the Small Business Administration or aid from other agenciesOne reason for the rejections is that many Puerto Ricans cannot prove that they own a home Only 65 percent of properties in the territory are officially registered with the government The problem is especially acute in small cities and rural areas where theres a custom of property owners not recording titles to homesIn Loza an oceanfront community of 30000 damage to homes and businesses was extensive Many small businesses in the town were closed for months and may never reopen Power was restored to most residences and businesses only in the first week of FebruaryFederal funds are only trickling into Loza and housing groups said one reason for the slowness was the small proportion of homes there perhaps 20 percent that are officially registered In a makeshift FEMA center agency workers allowed property owners to submit a written declaration that they owned their home But advocates said some were still being rejectedNearby stray horses ambled along the beachThe halting pace of the economic recovery worries business leaders like Eli S Seplveda Morell an executive vice president at Banco Popular Puerto Ricos largest lender His biggest concern is a shortage of

AdvertisementSupported byOpEd ContributorBut racial bias training for employees is not enough to address the epidemic of discrimination by American companiesOver the past two years we have investigated discrimination in customer service by conducting largescale field experiments in the hospitality industry We have repeatedly found that frontline workers exhibit racial bias in the quality of customer service they provideThe inquiry these fictitious people made was simple They asked for local restaurant recommendations We tracked whether hotel employees responded and also analyzed the content of the emails from those who did respondAcross the range of responses racial discrimination was clear Overall hotel employees were significantly more likely to respond to inquiries from people who had typically white names than from those who had typically black and Asian names But racial bias did not end there Discrimination also happened in many subtle waysHotel employees provided 20 percent more restaurant recommendations to white than to black or Asian people Employees politeness also varied by race When responding to white people employees were more likely to address them by name and to end their emails with a complimentary close eg Best Sincerely than they were when responding to black or Asian people And employees were more likely to go above and beyond in their service They were three times as likely to provide extra information  even when the initial inquiry was just about restaurants  to white than to black or Asian peopleOur research suggests that this belief  that a nonwhite person cannot or will not be a legitimate customer  can indeed worsen discrimination in service delivery In a followup study we emailed nearly 2000 hotels and made a similar inquiry about local restaurants But this time in addition to varying the race of the inquirers we varied whether they made clear their intention to stay at the hotel Indeed making customer status explicit helped reduce discrimination against minority people These results are in line with the recent incident at Starbucks We see that service workers do not apply the rule that every person is a potential customer deserving the same level of serviceBut even before putting new processes in place for employees to follow companies must systematically assess the current state of their customer service We encourage businesses to begin by conducting internal audit studies of customer service Many of the service behaviors we discussed are subtle To detect bias in these behaviors requires quantifying different aspects of customer service and comparing treatment quality across a range of customers After all a store manager may conclude that an employee is doing a great job upon hearing him say Have a great day to an Asian customer but not recognize that the same employee says Have a great day You should come back and try our new blonde cappuccino with soy to a white customer It is only after identifying these disparities that companies can develop targeted interventions to combat biasesWe urge companies not to stop at racial bias training Structural changes in how service is delivered are necessary Large corporations especially have the opportunity  and even an imperative  to be part of the solutionAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,business

AdvertisementSupported byI didnt mean to do it It just sort of happened But what began with an empty wallet on New Years Day has evolved into something akin to a lifestyle changeIve gone cashlessFor the first three months of the year I have hardly touched paper money or metal coins There are no grimy bills folded alongside my drivers license No quarters or pennies jangling in my pocketInstead Ive relied almost exclusively on credit cards Apple Pay online orders and the occasional generosity of an unsuspecting friendIm here to encourage my fellow Americans to reconsiderMy unintentional experiment began on Jan 1 as I awoke with a rumpled tuxedo a mild hangover and no money in my pocketThe night before I had imbibed at various bars handing out the 60 or so in my wallet as tips to bartenders kind enough to work a holiday As the first days of January passed I never bothered to go to an ATM and withdraw a wad of cash I didnt need toHere in New York City as well as just about everywhere these days its possible to pay for nearly everything with a card or a phoneGrocery shopping was similarly easy our kitchen restocked using a mix of Amazoncom Fresh Direct and trips to my local market where I paid with a credit card And so it went Before I knew it February had arrived and my wallet was still emptyI vividly remember the first time I heard someone describe a world without cash It was 2012 and I was at an event in London listening to Ajay Banga the chief executive of Mastercard extol the virtues of digital currencies and the problems with paper moneyCash he argued enabled all sorts of bad behavior Drug dealers illicit arms traders tax evaders and sex traffickers all rely on cash he said Make cash obsolete and those nefarious activities get much more difficult Plus cash is dirty a vector for germs and diseaseIt was a compelling argument but at the time my wallet stuffed with colorful plasticy pounds I thought he was crazy Old habits die hard and humans have been using cash in one form or another for roughly 7000 yearsYet since that trip to London Mr Bangas words have been rattling around my head and sure enough Ive found myself relying less and less on cashThen last month I signed up for the Amazon Prime Rewards card which gives me 5 percent back on all purchases on Amazon and at Whole Foods two major cost centers for our household These arent exactly lifechanging windfalls but the benefits accrue over time something cash cant offerTo be sure there have been some downsides along the way Chief among them Tipping isnt easyAs I checked out of a hotel in Charleston SC I didnt have anything to offer the valet which made me look  and feel  cheap The next week I got a haircut I paid for the trim with my card but my barber accepted tips only in cash Again I felt miserlyAnd when I got an overpriced drink with some New York Times colleagues at the steakhouse below our newsroom I had to add my tip to the credit card bill a decidedly less satisfying experience than leaving a few singles on the barThere were other instances when I missed cash too When panhandlers asked me for spare change I had nothing to offer and felt a pang of guilt One day I was late to pick up my toddlers from day care and the school demanded 50 in cash Rather than consent I fought the charge and got away with a warning but it was a close callAnother time I took the kids to a carousel only to discover it was cash only Luckily my cousin was with us and lent me 4 narrowly averting a very public temper tantrumFor the most part however I realized Id be totally fine if cash went the way of the fax machineRecently I got back in touch with Mr Banga of Mastercard wanting to compare notes He said that while he didnt see cash disappearing entirely anytime soon he  no surprise  had mostly let it goI use very little cash in the course of a month he said Mostly just for tippingLike Mr Banga Im not saying Ill never use cash again I will give it out to the homeless and tip hardworking service employees But if the day comes when cash disappears altogether you wont hear me complainingIn February I set out on a trip to Southern California my wallet still empty I Ubered to the airport in New York Ubered to the hotel in Los Angeles and used the usual variety of digital payments to get around eat and shop Cash didnt just seem nonessential it was practically invisibleThen one night in Ojai Calif my own cashless streak came to an end I was out for dinner with my family and some old friends and I picked up the bill putting it on my Sapphire Reserve card I was planning to treat the table but before I noticed what was happening my friend tossed two 20 bills on top of my wallet and said thanksThat was that I picked up the bills briefly

AdvertisementSupported byOpEd ContributorIn the wake of the school shootings in Parkland Fla companies like Delta Hertz and Symantec distanced themselves from the National Rifle Association by eliminating benefits to their membersDicks Sporting Goods which owns 35 Field and Stream stores which feature hunting gear and supplies took it a step further The company announced that it had unilaterally raised the age limit for firearms sales and stopped selling the AR15 the weapon used in Parkland and other recent mass shootings The chief executive Edward Stack said that the company was going to take a stand and step up and tell people our view and hopefully bring people along into the conversation Less than 24 hours later Walmart joined Dicks in raising the age limit on firearm sales Walmart stopped selling AR15s years agoSome companies have benefited through gains in popularity or even sales by taking such stands Patagonia reportedly saw a revenue surge after announcing its lawsuit against the Trump administrations efforts to slash the size of Bears Ears National Monument in Utah My research with Michael Toffel of Harvard Business School finds that consumers were more likely to buy Apple products after hearing Tim Cooks statement opposing Indianas religious freedom billBut other firms have faced angry consumers and had to retrench as Target did when hundreds of thousands of people signed a petition in protest of its transinclusive bathroom policy The chief executive of Papa Johns who blamed the National Football Leagues handling of the national anthem controversy for his companys declining sales stepped down after he was criticized for his commentsWhat has not happened in any of these cases is a cooling of partisan tensions Even in rare cases when pragmatic business leaders helped to broker agreements which was reportedly the case in North Carolina with the repeal of the socalled bathroom bill a culture war still festersCEO activism has typically not brought people together working from the middle out Instead this type of activism largely from the progressive side has begun to galvanize conservatives For example in Georgia lawmakers stripped tax breaks for Delta over its decision to cut ties with the NRAIn the short term Dicks will become another corporate poster child for how political polarization and socalled negative partisanship  an automatic rejection of members of the opposing party  are infecting our society There will be a rash of news stories about increased sales from liberal consumers rushing into Dicks stores to vote with their wallets Conservative media will point to boycotts and highlight other retailers that are stepping in to serve disaffected consumersBut the real story will be the long game CEO activism represents a historic shift in the way corporations intersect with national politics Rather than chief executives shaping political discourse however our toxic political environment is dictating corporate strategy Instead of being cast as practical technocrats who could unite us chief executives will be swept up in our cultural war just like university presidents celebrities professional athletes and religious leaders before themBrands are likely to become even more segmented into red and blue strengthening the association between liberals and Priuses and conservatives and Cracker Barrel Corporate brand campaigns could soon resemble political campaigns with efforts to identify the most intensely loyal consumers for repeat purchases as opposed to attracting new onesMainstream brands may become as common as moderate politicians  that is a rare perhaps extinct species in todays political environment Twitter and PayPal serve diverse customers today but their recent efforts to regulate their own platforms have led to allegations of political bias and incited competitorsMost companies are not prepared for this new world of politics Pepsi and Starbucks have already been victims of orchestrated fake news campaigns there will be many more As more companies take stands those remaining will be named and shamed on social media creating impossible choices in an environment where neutrality is not an optionLike our politicians corporate chiefs will have to quickly figure out what stand they should take on the issue of the day by reflecting on their core convictions and estimating how their customer base will react Like pollsters they will have to assess which kind of consumers they can write off and which ones to curry favor with The right answer will vary by a companys geographic location who their employees are and how much they depend on favorable government regulationThere is no going back Lists are being kept and wins are being tallied by pressure groups aiming to get companies on their side The issues that divide us will keep being served up in relentless succession forcing companies to take stands on just about everythingMuch of this is a reflection of who we have become Corporate America thrives by selling us what we want and they do that by appealing to our identities In 2018 for many Americans our political identity seems to define us more than ever It already influences whom we socialize with on Facebook whom we marry what news we read and where we live It was only a matter of time before this big sort started to shape

AdvertisementSupported byOpEd ContributorMr Trudolyubov editsThe Russia File a blog published by the Kennan Institute in WashingtonMOSCOW  Last month Vladimir V Putin was reelected as Russias president in a plebiscitelike ceremony with all other candidates essentially decorating the ballots margins Years of aggressive campaigning tinkering with electoral rules and eliminating competition had long prepared the field for an easy winThe tough part now for Mr Putin is to deal with the consequences of 18 years of being able to do whatever he pleases His fourth term fifth if we count the four years of Dmitri Medvedevs presidency as what they were a Putin regency is off to a tumultuous startYet there is a sphere where progress has been steady throughout the Putin years  in spreading acceptance of the principles that underlie his rule For years Russia watchers and Russians themselves have asked to what extent the Kremlin is driven by an ideology or at least by a consistent value system Is it nationalism isolationism irredentism judoFar from any belief or ideology the principles form an ethos something you must get to make progress in the society Russias rulers no longer bow to any ideology But they do follow some basic working rulesFirst A disaster natural or manmade makes the state vulnerable After an explosion flood or fire enemies of the state can try to hold the authorities accountable How an emergency is covered in the news is as important as how it is resolved This is why the Kremlin rushed to place all federal television channels under control immediately after the early disasters of the Putin era the submarine Kursk sinking in 2000 and the 2002 terrorist siege at a Moscow theater One consequence of this view is a conviction that all information disseminated through channels outside state control including social media is damaging and foreignfunded A few days ago the Russian government moved to block the popular messenger and social network Telegram after its owner refused to give the secret police access to the networks user dataSecond A threat originates only from an external or foreign source That is why laws and rules regulating foreign companies foreignfunded nongovernmental organizations and religions and ideologies considered fringe have proliferated Wild hints that big foreign interests are behind a given problem is the first trope on staterun media after any disaster or potentially damaging episode It follows that all grassroots activism not authorized by the state has a foreign origin and is foreignfundedThird A civil servant is accountable only to his or her superior not to the public It follows that a subordinate can be held accountable but the superior standing at the very top can be seen only as a savior not responsible for any wrong You do not blame President Putin for anything you only appeal to him for justice From this it also follows that in Mr Putins view there is no right to resist or to overthrow a government no matter how terrible or murderous it is That is why Bashar alAssad of Syria stays in placeThose are the laws Mr Putin has followed domestically and internationally during most of his ruleThe destruction of real accountability the neversaysorry attitude and the rejection of grassroots activism are widely accepted as realities in Russia if not as universal truthsWhenever President Putin is touted as the worlds most powerful or influential politician I feel puzzled The rules that Mr Putin follows are technical He is no philosopher of government he is a skilled practitioner These rules are simply ad hoc mechanisms for holding onto power in a dangerous environment And the Kremlin political managers are skillful plumbers who deal with old leaky piping and loathe the idea of replacing itDo other nations really have anything to learn from themI would argue that perceived similarities between President Trumps thinking and Mr Putins do not necessarily mean that Mr Trump has been learning from Russias president When your objective like Mr Trumps is surviving in power you arrive on your own at pragmatic rules that work for you The extent to which President Trump values survival is unique among Western leaders Mr Putin has been fighting for survival for years and he has become a grandmaster of that dark artBut playing this game has consequences Just as the Kremlin has ad hoc rules most Russians have some too They get what it takes to prosper in their system Pretend you are loyal tell the interviewer you approve of the president mark the right box and there you go FreedomThis doesnt sound heroic but heroes are a rare breed The Russian people and the Russian state cohabitate each minding its own businessDisasters and tragedies are occasions when state and people meet Sparks of conflict start to fly because both sides realize theyve been fooling each other The Kremlin and its viceroys have pretended to manage and the people on the ground have pretended to be loyal Theres a crisis of loyalty if you will Its not that loyalty is lacking its that theres too much loyalty and its all fake And that brings a moment of truth when everyone realizes that Russians would jump at any opportunity to turn their relationship with the state back on its feetBut all of that goes away quickly because it bumps up against precisely what the Kremlin is there for to close down the pockets of normalcy Any attempt at holding the president accountable is made so costly for the people and the propaganda of the opposite view is so relentless that Russians put up with all of this just to stay out of trouble and have a normal lifeThe principles recounted above are not the sort in which you choose to believe they must be imposed And by the time you recognize that a system like this is around you it is probably too late to resist You will have to learn the Putin creed or something similarSo really there is no rush to learn from himAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,business
AdvertisementSupported byKenneth C Frazier the chief executive of the pharmaceuticals company Merck served on one of Mr Trumps business advisory councils in the early days of the administrationBut after Mr Trump equivocated in his response to an outburst of white nationalist violence last August in Charlottesville Va the advisory groups swiftly unraveledIn a recent interview with The New York Times Mr Frazier elaborated for the first time on his motivation for taking a stanceIt was my view that to not take a stand on this would be viewed as a tacit endorsement of what had happened and what was said he said I think words have consequences and I think actions have consequences I just felt that as a matter of my own personal conscience I could not remainThe events that led to Mr Fraziers confrontation with the president unfolded over a tense summer weekend as white nationalists gathered in Charlottesville to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E Lee Bloody fighting broke out as they clashed with counterdemonstrators one of whom was killed when a selfdescribed neoNazi drove his car into a crowd of peopleI saw what was happening on that Friday night and then I heard the horrible news about what had happened on Saturday with the young woman being killed and others being run down by a person who was sympathetic to people who held views that I consider personally noxious Mr Frazier said And then I heard the presidents responseMr Trump speaking at a veterans event at one of his golf clubs condemned the violence but did not criticize the white nationalists chanting neoNazi slogans He blamed hatred bigotry and violence on many sides on many sidesThe presidents remarks drew widespread condemnation for appearing to equate the actions of the counterprotesters with those of neoNazis and many Americans including Mr Frazier found them deeply inadequateIn that moment the presidents response was one that I felt was not in concordance with my views Mr Frazier said And I didnt think they were in concordance with the views that we claim to hold as a countryBefore announcing his decision to resign from the presidents manufacturing council Mr Frazier consulted with the Merck boardI wanted to say that this was a statement I was making in terms of my own values and the companys values and there was unanimous support for that he said My board supported that 100 percentThen on Monday morning Merck posted a statement from Mr Frazier on TwitterI am resigning from the Presidents American Manufacturing Council it read in part Our countrys strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths races sexual orientations and political beliefsThe president not one to let a slight go swiftly hit back on TwitterNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from Presidents Manufacturing Council he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES the president wroteMr Frazier doesnt regret his initial decision to advise the presidentI joined because I think Merck is an important company and has something to contribute to the discussion about how we could as a country become much more competitive in the global economy he said I joined because the president asked me to join and I thought it was the right thing to do as the CEO of a company like MerckAnd Mr Trumps remarks after Charlottesville were not the first time that Mr Frazier found himself at odds with the presidentThere were things that happened earlier on in this administration that I didnt necessarily agree with about immigration and climate change but I didnt think that it was my role to actually speak out on those issues he said Theres a process for deciding how we address those issues as a country This is a democracyBut he viewed Mr Trumps unwillingness to condemn white nationalists as differentIn this case we were not talking about politics Mr Frazier continued We were talking about the basic values of the countryMr Frazier did not respond to the presidents tweet and has not spoken publicly about the episode until nowFor a man who rose to the pinnacle of corporate America Mr Frazier came from a humble background His grandfather was born into slavery in South Carolina and his father was a janitor in Philadelphia Yet Mr Fraziers parents pushed him to believe he could achieve great thingsThey believed that despite the history of this country as it related to AfricanAmericans that for my siblings and I there would be tremendous opportunity he said They also instilled that it was our responsibility to take advantage of the opportunities that they did not haveMr Frazier attended Pennsylvania State University After earning a degree from Harvard Law School he went to work at Drinker Biddle  Reath a law firm in Philadelphia While there he began representing Merck and took on pro bono workHe spent several summers in South Africa teaching black law students And he took on the case of James Willie Cochran known as Bo a black inmate on death row who had been convicted of killing a white store managerAfter looking at the evidence Mr Frazier and his colleagues became convinced of Mr Cochrans innocence They eventually secured him a new trial and he was acquitted in 1997It was by far the most important thing that Ive ever done in my life full stop professionally Mr Frazier said This is a man who was facing an execution date for a crime he did not commitMr Frazier joined Merck 1992 and rose through the ranks overseeing the companys defense against lawsuits related to the antiinflammatory drug Vioxx and as chief executive since 2011 making the development of drugs to treat cancer a priorityEarly in his tenure as chief executive Mr Frazier resisted calls to cut research and development spending and focus on profitability We value R  D as a company he said Its who we areMr Frazier has little interest in dwelling on his feud with Mr Trump and would rather stay out of politics altogether Yet when confronted last summer with a stance he considered unconscionable Mr Frazier said he could not help but speak outWhat happened that weekend I think was not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue he said I think that really went to the core of who we say we are as AmericansAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,business

The brash ambitious founders of WeWork a global network of shared office spaces want nothing less than to transform the way we work live and playSupported byOn a cold February morning at the Brooklyn Navy Yard the skeleton of a modern 15story building was rising from a muddy construction site along the East River As long and as tall as a cruise ship the sleek glass structure loomed above rusty centuryold dry docks serving notice to the industrial neighborhood that the new economy was comingWhen Dock 72 is completed this year if the aggressive timeline holds it will represent the fullest expression of Mr Neumanns expansive vision to date There will be an enormous coworking space a luxury spa and large offices for other companies like IBM and Verizon that are designed and run by WeWork There will be a juice bar a real bar a gym with a boxing studio an outdoor basketball court and panoramic vistas of Manhattan There will be restaurants and maybe even dry cleaning services and a barbershopIt will be the kind of place you never have to leave until you need to go to sleep  and if Mr Neumann has his way youll sleep at one of the apartments he is renting nearbyIts an allencompassing sort of ambition and Mr Neumann is the brash and idealistic pitchman Simply by encouraging strangers to share a beer at the office he argues WeWork can heal our fractured societyHow do you change the world Mr Neumann asked in a recent interview Bring people together Where is the easiest big place to bring people together In the work environmentIt may sound simplistic but around the globe companies are buying whatever it is that Mr Neumann and his cofounder Miguel McKelvey are selling WeWork has rapidly expanded to 20 countries assembled a formidable executive team and attracted some 200000 members Big companies like JPMorgan Chase and Siemens are signing on as tenants and revenues are growing fast expected to top 23 billion this yearA company ostensibly about coworking now employs yoga instructors architects teachers environmental scientists software engineers molecular biologists and social psychologistsIs it all a bit much for a young company still trying to build out its core business Ive made that argument said Bruce Dunlevie a WeWork board member and partner at the venture capital firm Benchmark But he said great entrepreneurs like Adam dont listen to guys like meAs WeWork expands in all directions it faces persistent questions about its rich valuation and the durability of its business model Critics argue that the company does little more than corporate real estate arbitrage  leasing a space spiffing it up then subleasing it out to other tenants The company owns hardly any properties giving it precious few hard assets Its growth projections strike many as unattainable and it has missed expectations before A number of upstarts loom as potential competitors seeking to replicate WeWorks success And many WeWork tenants are unproven startups that could quickly foldIWG a publicly traded coworking company that has more members and more real estate than WeWork is valued at just 2 billion Yet Mr Neumann has convinced investors that WeWork is worth 10 times that figureAdams explanation for the valuation of WeWork speaks for itself said Chris Kelly cofounder and president of Convene a company that offers flexible event spaces and is backed by major real estate firms This is not an Excel spreadsheet calculation He believes theres an energy behind the brand and hes gotten people to invest at that valuation He has not tried to explain it in traditional financial termsIndeed to assess WeWork by conventional metrics is to miss the point according to Mr Neumann WeWork isnt really a real estate company Its a state of consciousness he argues a generation of interconnected emotionally intelligent entrepreneurs And Mr Neumann with his combination of inspiration and chutzpah wants to transform not just the way we work and live but the very world we live inIts an audacious perhaps delusional plan for a company that made its mark by building communal desks and providing refreshments And so far it seems to be workingMr Son WeWorks largest investor is betting that the company will grow exponentially in the years to come making his multibilliondollar investment a veritable bargainThe notion that whitecollar workers might actually like their offices is a relatively new one From the countinghouses of industrial England to the skyscrapers of 1980s Manhattan offices were mostly uninspiring places designed to maximize space often with row upon row of unglamorous desksThe only kind of model that anyone had for laying out a large workplace was a factory said Nikil Saval author of Cubed A Secret History of the Workplace So the office was made to resemble an assembly lineThis dreary state of affairs began to change in earnest at least for some during the dotcom bubble Tech companies built playful offices with beanbags and PingPong tables making work spaces less formal Free food became commonplaceRaised expectations for amenities and interior design gradually seeped into the mainstream and today more and more employees  especially millennials  expect enlightened unconventional officesEnter WeWork With people bouncing between employers jobs concentrated in cities and technology making it easier to work remotely the demand for coworking was suddenly real and ready to be monetized Mr Neumann who grew up on a kibbutz in Israel had an epiphany Bring the communal vibe to the officeSoon he and a friend  Mr McKelvey an equally tall Oregonian who grew up on a collective and was working as an architect  founded an ecofriendly coworking space in Brooklyn They sold it but they quickly turned around and started WeWork in 2010Me and Miguel have this common ground Mr Neumann said We both grew up in very close communitiesWeWork didnt invent coworking spaces of course IWG better known as Regus has been around for decades But Mr Neumann and Mr McKelvey quickly hit upon a recipe that drew throngs of startups an industrial chic aesthetic some big common areas with comfy couches free beer and pipedin pop musicIndividuals pay as little as 45 a month for occasional access to a desk in a common area Startups can pay a few thousand dollars for a private room on a monthtomonth basis and some big companies pay millions of dollars a year for spaces that hold thousands of employees over multiple locationsIts a formula that has caught on from New York to Tel Aviv to Shanghai In New York alone WeWork has 49 spaces most of them nearly full At the WeWork in Harlem dance companies share space with hair care startups in a common area adorned with murals of jazz musicians At a WeWork in TriBeCa fashion designers and alcohol distributors work shoulder to shoulder in a spartan space decorated with neon lightingFor WeWork to really succeed in changing the way we all work it is going to have to win over big corporations seeking space for thousands of employees The strategy is an odd reversal for WeWork which made its name catering to freelancers and startupsThe Weather Channel recently moved its ad sales team into an enormous WeWork in Midtown Manhattan Barbara Bekkedahl who runs the group said the transition was easy and the space comfortable and stylishBut Ms Bekkedahl had a complaint too one that highlights one of the downsides of communal work space She suggested that the hygienic and sartorial habits of some of her new office mates were lackingAs a TV sales team we groom and dress for outside sales she said Some of the techie and startup types housed at WeWork arent facing customers all day so dont always have the same standardsGripes about grooming are unlikely to slow down WeWorks business with corporate clients especially if Mr Neumann makes good on his promise to save them money Because WeWork is building out so much space and buying so much furniture Mr Neumann says he can renovate and operate an office for a fraction of the cost that companies would normally spendWe have economies of scale he said Ill cut your operational costs between 20 to 50 percentIt might seem like another instance of Mr Neumanns talking a big game but for the fact that more and more companies  GE HSBC Salesforce and Microsoft among them  are signing onFor years now big companies have outsourced payroll processing janitorial services and security Its not a stretch to imagine more of them outsourcing the design and maintenance of their offices to a company like WeWorkWe only have 200000 members Mr McKelvey 43 said Thats ridiculous We need to have two million and then 20 millionBankers and lawyers poured out of skyscrapers and made for the suburbs on a recent Monday night in Manhattans financial district But at 110 Wall Street a building controlled entirely by WeWork the party was just getting startedLast year this 1960sera office tower was converted into a mixeduse development of Mr Neumanns design There is a coworking space On the ground floor are trendy restaurants including Westville Fuku Momofuku Milk Bar and a bar called the Mail RoomAnd then there is a WeLive a complex of about 200 fully furnished apartments rented out on a shortterm basis Tenants get the signature WeWork aesthetic of unpolished wood and wrought iron as well as various perks There are hot tubs on the terrace There are arcade games and a pool table in the laundry room There are a chefs kitchen and a communal dining room At a bar on a residential floor a happy hour was brewing and free Tempranillo was flowingThe brothers are all in They live in WeLive work in the adjacent WeWork space and exercise at WeWorks nearby gym RiseIts awesome Jake DeCicco said You just roll out of bed go down the elevator and get to workHad Mr Neumann been there to share a beer those words would have been music to his ears He believes that creating a work and living environment where people mingle is in fact a worldchanging innovation Each WeWork has a community manager who keeps tabs on members makes introductions and organizes social activitiesIf more strangers are colliding by the grapefruit water the thinking goes they are more likely to meet up and invest in one anothers socially responsible startups and then the world will be a better placeOnce you choose to enter a WeWork you choose to be part of something more we than me Mr Neumann said People start coming together Theyll see each other in the elevator they talk in the stairways Theres a thousand other things they doElevators Stairways Hardly worldchanging innovations But WeWork takes extra steps to encourage fraternization Like beer kegs that never run dryMore than most companies WeWork promotes the consumption of alcohol as an inherent virtue Posters on the wall encourage people to have a drink There are wine tastings at WeLive Company parties feature topshelf liquor Mr Neumann has a wellknown penchant for tequila and a wellstocked bar is prominent in his officeOn a recent Tuesday at 407 pm the community manager of a WeWork in Midtown Manhattan sent an email reading Its time to get your creative juices flowing Join us on the 5th floor to drink some wine  paint a beautiful picture Just after noon on Valentines Day there was an invitation to share wine and cake in the common areaBut so far nothing  not alcohol labor disputes questions about the business fundamentals or bad publicity  has managed to alter the companys trajectoryWere a disrupter of the way people view the spaces they work in on a daytoday basis said Mr Dunlevie of Benchmark And were in the early days of taking advantage of that phenomenonIn September WeWork will open its most ambitious project to date a kindergarten It may also be the effort that tests whether WeWork is flying too close to the sunThe creation of Mr Neumanns wife Rebekah 39 the school is known as WeGrow When it opens it promises a welldesigned space with a curriculum that emphasizes socializing and entrepreneurship for 3yearolds on upWeGrow fits neatly into Mr Neumanns expansive vision for creating a generation of empathetic social impact entrepreneurs But the riskreward calculus is different when starting a schoolWeGrow wont scale as rapidly as WeWork has so the financial upside is limited Yet should something go wrong the fallout could be devastating Its one thing to be responsible for the internet going out or paper running low at the communal printer Its another thing to take responsibility for the health and development of someones childWe all understand how complicated and regulated school is compared to the simpler business that we are already in Mr Neumann said But we decided were going to go into education If you really want to change the world change kids when theyre 2As he proselytized Mr Neumann was sitting on an enormous leather couch in his Chelsea office which is bigger than many New York City apartments It included a conference table a video conferencing setup several desks a bar spreads of food a Peloton exercise bike a climbing machine a boxing bag hanging from the ceiling a gong an antechamber where assistants work and a private bathroomIts going to work Mr Neumann continued Is it going to be perfect Definitely not Are we going to make mistakes A hundred percent Are we going to be comfortable admitting those mistakes Definitely Its what we do hereThough such unbridled zeal can be abrasive to some it could also be viewed as the mark of a peripatetic savant Walter Isaacson the biographer of Steve Jobs Albert Einstein Benjamin Franklin and Leonardo da Vinci counts Mr Neumann as a friend and said he shared some of the attributes that had allowed those other titans to succeedIt can be tempting to dismiss WeWork as just another overvalued startup that is high on its own rhetoric and flush with easy money from nave investors With little more than faddish interior design free beer and an invitation to socialize with strangers Mr Neumann claims to have conjured up a whole new paradigm for whitecollar workers  and for education  and vows that it can change the worldIts the kind of utopian prattle that can come off as dangerously out of touch at a moment when a backlash against big tech is brewing But if any of these potential pitfalls concern Mr Neumann he doesnt show itOn this the first night of festivities Mr Neumann would oversee a Shark Tanklike competition for socially responsible small businesses  ranging from a startup that made customized prosthetics to a fooddelivery service staffed by refugees  each vying for a 1 million prizeEarlier Mr Neumann had rattled off the companys achievements and outlined some of its more outsize ambitions As the evenings performer the Grammywinning rapper Macklemore waited backstage Mr Neumann went on an impromptu riff about how people should make a life not just a living the companys aspirational mottoMr Neumann also stated that it was important to support social entrepreneurs Of course that makes a lot of sense but whos going to pay for that he said And we said Well Masa mightThe line generated a laugh among the hundreds of knowing employees in the room  Mr Son whose nickname is Masa was conveniently absent  but it was a tell from Mr Neumann a sly admission that at this point he is playing with house moneyConfetti fell from the rafters The winners cried on stage Mr Neumann took it all in beamingEven Macklemore was taken aback by all the money flying around I was just watching it chugging a Red Bull he said shortly into his set and I immediately thought Damn I should have got into technologyAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,business

AdvertisementSupported byHe was a personalinjury lawyer who often worked out of taxi offices scattered around New York CityThere was the one above the rundown auto repair garage on West 16th Street in Manhattan on the edge of the Meatpacking District before it turned trendy There was the singlestory building with the garish yellow awning in the shadow of the Queensboro Bridge There was the tan brick place on a scruffy Manhattan side street often choked with doubleparked taxisAnd then there was his office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower overlooking Fifth Avenue right next to the one belonging to Donald J TrumpBefore he joined the Trump Organization and became Mr Trumps lawyer and doitall fixer Michael D Cohen was a hardedge personalinjury attorney and businessman Now a significant portion of his quartercentury business record is under the microscope of federal prosecutors  posing a potential threat not just to Mr Cohen but also to the presidentMr Cohens businesses are private entities making it difficult to get a full picture of their finances and operations But a New York Times review of thousands of pages of public records and interviews with bankers lawyers and businessmen who have interacted with Mr Cohen reveal the degree to which he has often operated in the backwaters of the financial and legal worldsWhile he has not been charged with a crime many of his associates have faced either criminal charges or stiff regulatory penalties That includes partners in the taxi business doctors for whom he helped establish medical clinics and lawyers with whom he workedHe has spent much of his personal and professional life with immigrants from Russia and Ukraine His fatherinlaw who helped establish him in the taxi business was born in Ukraine as was one of Mr Cohens partners in that industry Another partner was Russian And Mr Cohen used his connections in the region when scouting business opportunities for Mr Trump in former Soviet republicsMore recently Mr Cohen and his fatherinlaw lent more than 25 million to a Ukrainian businessman who has a checkered financial record and a history of defaulting on loans And Mr Cohen long held a small stake in his uncles catering hall which was frequented by Russian and Italian mobstersIn addition to his legal and taxi businesses Mr Cohen has had a seemingly charmed touch as a real estate investor On one day in 2014 he sold four buildings in Manhattan for 32 million entirely in cash That was nearly three times what he paid for them no more than three years earlierThis is the type of person youd see most bankers steer clear of said Ben Berzin a retired executive vice president and senior credit officer at PNC Bank who clashed with Mr Trump in the early 1990s over loans to the future presidents troubled Atlantic City casinos The speed with which Mr Cohen successfully flipped real estate stands out Mr Berzin said You have to ask whats going onMr Cohen after being sent a detailed list of questions about his business interests responded in a text message You need to do real fact checking as your questions are totally inaccurate Neither he nor his lawyers have offered further commentBut the president has long entrusted Mr Cohen to represent him in matters both public and deeply private real estate negotiations from Fresno Calif to the Republic of Georgia and the hushmoney payment to an adultfilm actress who said she had had an affair with the future president Or as Mr Trump put it this crazy Stormy Daniels dealThe 130000 payment to the actress is in a way emblematic of Mr Cohens many business dealings Its provenance is murky obfuscated by a private agreement pseudonyms and evolving explanations President Trump said this past week that he had paid Mr Cohen a retainer that was used to reimburse the 130000 directly contradicting his earlier statements that he knew of no payment to Ms DanielsWithin the Trump Organization it was Mr Cohens job to deal with Mr Trumps thorniest problems But now whatever problems investigators find in Mr Cohens own array of businesses could double back on Mr TrumpMy cousins are all either lawyers or doctors Mr Cohen told The New York Times last yearOne of those relatives was his uncle Dr Morton W Levine Uncle Morty as he was known to his family had no children of his own and he and Mr Cohen were close He even let his nephew drive his BentleyDr Levine a family practitioner provided medical assistance to members of the Lucchese crime family which aided their illegal activities according to a sworn affidavit in 1993 from an FBI special agent The agent was involved in the investigation of the Lucchese underboss Anthony Gaspipe Casso who regarded Levine as someone who would do anything for him according to the affidavit That account was buttressed by testimony from a longtime Lucchese associate in an unrelated 2006 federal trial In 1992 Dr Levine bought Mr Cassos home while Mr Casso was a fugitive Dr Levine has acknowledged in court documents that Mr Casso was a patient But he said he did not know that the house belonged to Mr Casso and denied any wrongdoingDr Levine also owned El Caribe a Brooklyn catering hall that for decades was the scene of mob weddings and Christmas parties Two of New Yorks most notorious Russian mobsters once maintained offices thereDr Levine had crossed paths with Mr Trump years before his nephew went to work for him The doctor was part of an investment group with some garment executives that unsuccessfully challenged Mr Trumps 1989 bid for the Atlantis Casino in Atlantic CityDr Levine declined to commentMr Cohen began his professional legal career at a personal injury firm in 1992 the year after he graduated from Cooley Law School in Michigan His boss at that first job would later plead guilty to briberyMr Cohens marriage in 1994 gave him entree to communities of immigrants from the former Soviet UnionHis new fatherinlaw Fima Shusterman had emigrated from Ukraine in 1975 By the time of the wedding Mr Shusterman had landed in serious legal trouble In 1993 he pleaded guilty to evading federal reporting requirements for large cash transactions admitting that he had cashed 55 million worth of checks to evade disclosure laws Mr Shusterman cooperated with prosecutors in a related case and was sentenced to probationIn the years after his marriage Mr Cohen began doing business with Ukrainian and Russian immigrants They hailed from New York Chicago and Florida in neighborhoods like the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn and parts of Miami like Sunny Isles known as the Russian Riviera communities through which a vein of organized crime ranIn 1999 Mr Cohen would find himself in the middle of a Sunny Isles real estate deal involving a hockey player and a purported figure from the Russian underworldNearly 20 years later the details of the transaction remain unclear but Mr Cohen received a check for 350000 from a Russian player for the Montreal Canadiens that was part of a deal involving an apartment in Sunny IslesThe players agent later testified that the money was intended to go to Vitaly Buslaev Mr Buslaev who has been identified by multiple Russian media outlets as a Mafia figure was a friend of one of Mr Cohens business partners according to two people who knew both menMr Cohen said in an interview last year that he did not know Mr Buslaev He declined to identify the person to whom he sent the 350000 saying only that he had honored the athletes request The money went to where it was directed to go he saidMr Cohens ventures with business partners from the former Soviet Union continued including a 2003 investment in a Florida casino boat with several Ukrainian immigrants that failed After that he helped members of his own family set up an ethanol production business in UkraineIt was through his wifes family that Mr Cohen would be introduced to the taxi business which would ultimately allow him to pull in millions of dollarsMr Cohens fatherinlaw Mr Shusterman initially found work as a taxi driver after arriving in the United States By 1993 he accumulated nine taxi medallions  the coveted metal placards that permit people to own or operate cabs  then worth roughly 15 millionMr Shusterman circulated among his fellow taxi operators trying to help Mr Cohen find work He introduced his soninlaw to Ilya Palinsky a longtime fixture in the business Mr Palinsky said his impression of Mr Cohen was that he talks a lot screams you know Hes a hyper guyNot long afterward Mr Cohen began building his own taxi business even as he was taking on personal injury work as a lawyerHe partnered with Symon Garber another Ukrainianborn businessman who was borrowing large amounts of money to finance taxi businesses in both Russia and the United States A lawyer for the two men said in a court filing that he had helped them lay the groundwork for a planned taxi business in Moscow in the mid1990s although it never materializedMr Cohen borrowed from a halfdozen banks and credit unions to buy taxi medallions Then he used the medallions as collateral to borrow more money to buy more medallions former colleagues said He quickly amassed 30 medallions each then worth about 250000 but racked up millions in debtTogether the two men managed 260 cabs in the late 1990s and early 2000s some for other owners Drivers paid them 100 a shift Millions of dollars in cash flowed in Mr Cohen at some point began carrying a licensed pistol in an ankle holsterDuring Mr Trumps 2016 campaign Mr Cohen pursued plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow with Felix Sater a Russian immigrant and friend of Mr Cohen who had worked on other real estate development deals with Mr Trump and had explored possible ventures in Russia Mr Trump and Mr Cohen worked with Mr Sater even after his role in a stock manipulation scheme involving Mafia figures and Russian criminals was revealed Mr Sater pleaded guilty and became an informant for the FBI and intelligence agenciesWhile juggling his Trump duties Mr Cohen turned over management of his cabs to Mr Garber in 2006 and received as much as 1 million per year legal records show After a fallingout with Mr Garber Mr Cohen became partners with Evgeny Freidman known as Gene an immigrant from St Petersburg Russia who had assembled a large taxi fleetBoth of Mr Cohens taxi partners had a history of legal runins Each has been made to pay more than 1 million for overcharging their drivers according to the New York State attorney general Former business partners also accused each of them of forging signatures stiffing lawyers and dodging debt collection effortsThe Chicago authorities found that Mr Garber and his taxi businesses used 180 unauthorized cars as taxis in that city he agreed to pay a fine of nearly 1 millionIn 2016 a federal judge found that Mr Freidman had transferred more than 60 million into offshore trusts to avoid paying debts Last April New York City regulators barred him from continuing to manage medallions He currently is awaiting trial in Albany on charges he failed to pay 5 million in taxesDespite the prohibition issued by city regulators Mr Freidman is still managing Mr Cohens medallions both men have saidCohen associated himself with the most reckless and greedy players in the industry said Bhairavi Desai the executive director of the Taxi Workers Alliance a group that represents cabdrivers They have simultaneously worked to inflate the value of their medallions and rip off their driversPatrick J Egan a lawyer for Mr Freidman said his client denies all the allegations against him Mr Freidman he said has been the victim of fabricated claims by former colleagues and politically motivated prosecutorsMr Garber did not respond to requests for commentFrom 2009 to 2014 Mr Cohen  by then a trusted member of the Trump Organization  plowed 57 million into 22 Chicago taxi medallions records showThe investments were ill timed The ascent of ridehailing services like Uber and Lyft decimated the value of medallions Since 2014 Mr Cohens companies have been falling behind on taxes Over all his taxi businesses in New York and Chicago owe more than 375000 for a variety of tax insurance and inspection problems according to records Fourteen of his 54 cabs were suspendedBut even as the industry has buckled Mr Cohen has continued to use his medallions as collateral to borrow money In December 2014 with his medallions worth 35 million he took out loans totaling at least 20 million from Sterling National Bank and Melrose Credit Union according to a banker who reviewed the transactions Documents related to both lenders were among the materials sought by federal prosecutors in their search warrantsIn 2016 Mr Cohen went so far as to dabble in financial engineering He spoke to investors about pooling distressed loans that financed taxi medallion purchases repackaging them and selling them to investors according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussions He also explored buying up such loans at a bargain price in anticipation that their value would recover the person said The outcome of those discussions was not clearThe financial maneuvering has continued even after the federal search warrants were executed On April 24 Mr Cohen refinanced all 16 of his taxi company medallion loans The transactions with Sterling National Bank appeared to extend the due dates on the loans by four years according to public filings on the refinanced loans And they added a new unusual source of collateral If Mr Cohen were to default Sterling would have the right to any money that Mr Freidman owes Mr CohenMany of Mr Freidmans taxi companies have declared bankruptcy Asked about the loans Mr Freidmans lawyer said his client had no assets that could be used as collateralSpokesmen for Sterling and Melrose declined to commentIt was unclear what Mr Cohen has done with all the money he has borrowed in recent years But he received some of the funds around the time that he and his fatherinlaw Mr Shusterman lent a combined 26 million to a Ukrainian immigrant and taxifleet operator named Semyon Shtayner real estate records showThe transactions were unusual Mr Shtayner has had nearly 17 million in judgments and liens against him over the years yet Mr Cohen made large loans backed by collateral that appears to be worth less than the value of the loansSince 2012 Mr Cohen has lent 6 million to Mr Shtayner whose family owns Chicago Medallion Management Corporation which manages more than 300 cabs in that city  including those owned by Mr Cohen The only collateral on the loans appears to be the Shtayners condominium in Sunny Isles purchased in 2009 for 235 millionNevertheless Mr Cohen and his fatherinlaw were willing lenders to Mr Shtayner who recently entered the marijuana cultivation business in NevadaSince last summer Mr Shusterman has lent 20 million to Mr Shtayners wife Yasya and two limited liability companies she controlsThis is a business exchange thats it Yasya Shtayner said in a brief phone interview when questioned about the loans from Mr Cohen Asked whether she had a lawyer who could speak on her behalf she said yes Then she hung upAfter he had built a taxi operation and a personal injury legal practice there was another element to Mr Cohens business dealings this one involving doctors and companies that operated on the fringes of the medical fieldStarting in 2000 Mr Cohen set up a series of companies in New York City There were two medical practices an acupuncture office two medical billing companies two management companies and a transportation companyThe ventures were noteworthy in part because they were created at a time when countless phony companies were cropping up to exploit socalled nofault auto insurance laws in New York and other states Hundreds of doctors businesses owners and others would eventually be criminally charged or accused of fraud by insurance companiesThere is no evidence that Mr Cohen or the companies he created were part of such schemes Nor is there evidence that Mr Cohen did anything other than register the companies with state authoritiesThe nofault insurance schemes which were often masterminded by organized crime figures from the former Soviet Union all followed a basic template Staged or exaggerated car accidents were used to generate a tidal wave of patients Transportation companies then took the patients  often lowlevel criminals  to what in many instances were sham medical clinics diagnostic testing offices and acupuncture and physical therapy offices Billing companies were created to collect money from insurers and management companies then siphoned the funds out to the schemes operators Some operators were so bold that they sued insurers that had stopped paying after they realized they were being defraudedMr Cohens role if any in the operation of the companies he helped set up was unclear The only people listed in the incorporation papers as having roles in the businesses are the two doctors Aleksandr Martirosov and Zhanna Kanevsky who were each affiliated with a medical practiceBut both of those doctors were accused of insurance fraud in connection with different medical practices they operatedDr Martirosov was arrested and charged with insurance fraud and grand larceny in 2003 A little more than a year earlier Mr Cohen had registered Avex Medical Care in Dr Martirosovs nameIn 2005 Dr Kanevsky was indicted on state racketeering charges the result of a lengthy wiretap investigation into phony accidents and medical claims Mr Cohen had registered Life Quality Medical Care on Dr Kanevskys behalf in April 2002Dr Kanevsky pleaded guilty to scheming to defraud in the second degree A man who answered two phone numbers listed in her name said no comment and hung upThe charges against Dr Martirosov were later dropped He did not respond to calls for comment or a message left at his home The same year he was arrested Dr Martirosov was named in a civil racketeering lawsuit brought by the insurance company Allstate in connection with his work for another medical business The suit accused dozens of doctors and business owners of trying to defraud insurers Dr Martirosov denied wrongdoingAvex Medical Care continued to operate after Dr Martirosovs arrest The company later sued insurers at a frenetic pace that averaged almost one lawsuit a week from 2003 to 2008 The suits targeted insurers that had balked at paying for treatments for accident victimsIn the late 1990s and early 2000s Mr Cohens personal injury practice filed hundreds of lawsuits largely stemming from auto accidents For part of that time a bustling bullpen of clerks and paralegals worked the phones at his Long Island City office They sought settlements with insurers and churned out suits on behalf of clients many of whom were referred to clinics that were later caught up in nofault insurance fraud investigationsDuring his time working at the Trump Organization Mr Cohen became a minor real estate baron in his own rightWhile his business is dwarfed by Mr Trumps assemblage of properties it is not insignificant From 2011 to 2015 limited liability companies connected to Mr Cohen purchased at least five buildings in Manhattan public records showLike many of Mr Cohens business dealings the transactions were unconventional His companies would buy a building often in cash Soon after they would flip the building in another allcash deal for four or five times the previous purchase price The buyer was generally another limited liability companyIn October 2011 for example a limited liability company listing as its address Mr Cohens apartment at Trump Park Avenue purchased a building on Rivington Street on Manhattans Lower East Side for 21 million In 2014 Mr Cohen sold the building for 10 million in cash  nearly five times what he paid three years earlierThat same day Mr Cohen sold three other Manhattan buildings also entirely for cash In total the four buildings sold for 32 million  nearly triple what Mr Cohen had paid for them in the span of no more than three yearsRichard K Gordon director of the Financial Integrity Institute at Case Western Reserve Universitys law school said that such real estate transactions  large profits achieved quickly involving cash purchases by LLCs  should raise red flagsIf I were the bank Id either refuse his business up front or rate him extra high risk said Mr Gordon who once led antimoneylaundering efforts for the International Monetary FundMr Trump is closely monitoring the investigations into his longtime counselor In recent weeks he has moved to simultaneously embrace Mr Cohen and keep him at arms lengthA few days later Mr Trump asserted that the investigation was unrelated to Mr Cohens work for himThe president added I hope hes in great shapeSusan C Beachy contributed reporting and

50s we were free to play games and sports that we chose or devised We picked teams made the rules and enforced them ourselves No officials monitored our activities and no adults oversaw or commented on how well or poorly we played Sure there were occasional spats but we learned how to resolve them on our own and get back to having funBut the concept of free play has since yielded to adultcontrolled games and hopes for glory among many of todays parents The way youth sports is promoted in many parts of the country these days can be anything but good for the children who engage in them according to leading experts who described their findings at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons in MarchToday adults are most often the organizers and enforcers of youth sports and too often they get in the way of their childrens best interests these experts sayAs Dr Charles A Popkin pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Columbia University Medical Center said at the meeting Sadly what parents want and what parents hope to gain from their childrens participation in youth sports is often at a significant extreme to what the kids actually wantHealthy competition is becoming unhealthy the orthopedics organization maintains More and more young athletes under the age of 12 are focusing on just one sport and training yearround The American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine defines specialization in youth sports as engaging in a sport for at least three seasons a year at the exclusion of other sportsToo often Dr Popkin and his associates at Columbia and medical centers elsewhere find themselves treating the fallout from early sports specialization when the participants develop overuse injuriesDr Mininder S Kocher pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Childrens Hospital Boston and another of the conferences speakers told me Ive been doing Tommy John surgery  an elbow reconstruction procedure often associated with professional baseball players  on more and more kids who damaged their arms by pitching for too many hours in too many games and practicesIn a prospective study of nearly 12000 youngsters with highly accurate histories of sportsrelated injuries Dr Kocher and colleagues found that early specialization in baseball cheerleading and gymnastics increased the risk of injury among boys and specialization in running swimming soccer and volleyball as well as cheerleading and gymnastics increased the injury risk among girlsThe injuries reported by their mothers all of whom are registered nurses included stress fractures tendinitis and knee injuries like tears of the anterior cruciate ligament or ACL that require surgical repairIntense and repetitive training can lead to pediatric trauma and may require surgery to young shoulders knees elbows and wrists the orthopedic surgeons organization reported It noted that in children whose bodies are still growing and developing excessive training in a single sport does not give them enough time to heal properlyDr Kocher said in an interview that children who grow up in the northern United States are more likely to become major league baseball players than kids from the South because they cant play their sport yearround and are less likely to be injuredBut even when not injured youngsters pressured to become star athletes often burn out and drop out sometimes from sports altogether Dr Kocher saidHe emphasized that parental influence on sports specialization can be profound and counterproductive if it doesnt mesh with the childs goals and interests If children are to be successful at a sport the drive to specialize and succeed must be intrinsic of their own choosingIn his study of 303 college athletes 98 percent currently playing one sport had previously played another organized sport before college They didnt begin to specialize until they were nearly 15 on average He noted that Mariano Rivera considered the best closing pitcher in baseball history had played soccer his favorite sport as a youth before focusing on baseball in his late teensYou want kids playing sports through life Dr Popkin said There are lots of benefits to later sports specialization at some point in high school The more sports kids play the better they learn adaptability They learn how to learnIts also important he said for kids to crosstrain by doing multiple sports so that they develop wholebody skills like balance quickness and core strength that can enhance their overall athletic abilityDr Popkin said that with the exception of a few individual sports like gymnastics tennis and fencing kids do better if they specialize later In his study of college athletes only 18 percent reported specializing by age 12 Fortyfive percent played multiple sports up to age 16 and there were no early specializers among those who played football lacrosse or field hockeyHis suggestions to parents Expose your children to as many activities as possible and support what they like But if theyre doing more hours of a sport a week than their age in years theyre overdoing itA couple of months of the year encourage them to do something else If they play soccer they could switch off to tennis if they play hockey they could try the track team Crosstraining helps their bodies and can keep them from burning outThis is the first of two columns on youth sports safetyAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,sports

AdvertisementSupported byDOHA Qatar  What do you do when your multibillion dollar sports network has been stolenExecutives at Qatars beIN Sports pondered that question last week as they stared at a bank of screens inside their sprawling headquarters here On the night of May 2 the networks main channel which functions as the ESPN of the Middle East televised the deciding game of the Champions League semifinal between AS Roma and LiverpoolThey watched the beIN Sports feed as Liverpool scored to take an early lead Then they watched the same play 10 seconds later on live coverage from beoutQ a bootlegging operation seemingly based in Saudi Arabia and whose roots lie in the bitter political dispute between Qatar and a coalition of countries led by its largest neighbors Saudi Arabia and the United Arab EmiratesThat night like every night for the past few months 10 beoutQ channels were live almost all of them screening the ostensibly exclusive and very expensive content of beIN which owns some of the most valuable sports rights in France Spain and TurkeyThe coalition countries have subjected Qatar to a punishing blockade over the past year accusing it of financing terrorism disrupting regional unity by warming up to Iran and harboring fugitives Qatar has denied the allegationsNow one month before the start of the World Cup the worlds mostwatched sporting event and beINs signature property the audacious piracy operation is positioned to illicitly deliver the tournaments 64 games to much of the Middle East Qatar despite abundant resources has been powerless to stop itDecoder boxes embossed with the beoutQ logo have for months been available across Saudi Arabia and are now for sale in other Arabspeaking countries A oneyear subscription costs 100 A Bangladeshi worker reached by phone at Sharif Electronics in Jeddah this week said his shop has been selling the boxes for three months Many people buy them he saidAs the Champions League semifinal unfolded last week Tom Keaveny beINs managing director for the Middle East who has worked in television for three decades gathered with a halfdozen beIN engineers in a small room known as the lab with a mandate Disrupt beoutQSo far they have not been successfulKeaveny said beoutQs operation takes industrial scale knowledge and ability and multimillion dollar fundingThis isnt someone in their bedroom he saidBeoutQs website claims its backers are a Colombian and Cuban consortium Officials at beIN said they had spent more than 200000 investigating the bootlegging and traced the beoutQ signal to the Riyadhbased satellite provider Arabsat Saudi Arabia is the companys largest investorGovernment officials in Saudi Arabia and its embassy did not respond to messages seeking commentFor more than a decade Qatar a desertstate smaller than Connecticut that controls much of the worlds liquefied natural gas supply has used sports to raise its profile It will play host to the World Cup in 2022 The countrys ruling family controls the Paris SaintGermain soccer team one of the most prominent in EuropeBeIN has committed several billion dollars to secure exclusive rights to the biggest sports events often paying far more than market value to ensure supremacy in the Arab world and beyond The network has become a national emblem for the emirate making the piracy of its broadcasts especially humiliatingThe name beoutQ is totally designed to intimidate said Mohammad AlSubaie executive director of commercial affairs for the beIN Media Group Being a Qatari I really feel angry about itThe dispute between Qatar and its neighbors has touched every aspect of life Qatar Airways flights must avoid neighboring airspace lengthening flight times Families with relatives in coalition countries have to see them in another location Some 12000 Qatari camels grazing on Saudi land were expelled Giant images of Qatars emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani have been plastered on scores of buildings in response to the blockade to stoke nationalist sentimentIt hasnt been an edifying conflict said David B Roberts a Gulf expert at Kings College in London Reports in the Saudi media that they will try to turn Qatar into an island by digging a canal along the QatarSaudi border and use the area to store nuclear waste sound childishIt didnt take long for beIN to conclude that the rogue channel was likely linked to Saudi ArabiaShortly after the dispute began Saudi Arabia banned the sale of beIN broadcast boxes and prohibited existing customers from paying their subscriptions to the channel Soon prominent Saudis including an adviser to the royal court began promoting the beoutQ website on social media Then beoutQ launched in October with 10 highdefinition channels Its owners geolocked it so only internet users in Saudi Arabia had accessThe website featured all major beIN content including soccer from around the world NBA games and marquee tennis tournaments BeoutQs backers emboldened by their ability to steal content at will have now started to add content owned by other broadcasters beyond beIN including fights in the Ultimate Fighting Championship mixedmartial arts leagueOfficials at beIN said they have been unable to find lawyers willing to pursue the case in Saudi courts but subpoenas issued in the United States to website hosting companies helped reveal that a credit card belonging to a man named Raed Kusheim paid for hosting fees Kusheim is the chief executive of Saudibased Selevision a distributor of settop boxes and ondemand broadcast servicesKusheim in a WhatsApp message denied any involvement in beoutQ He said he was involved in an unrelated legal dispute with beIN He did not respond to a direct question about his credit cardSince October settop boxes have been appearing throughout Saudi Arabia loaded with access to the channels over the internet and on satellite television Those boxes deliver hundreds of premium channels from around the world BeINs antipiracy team traced the signal to space on the Arabsat satelliteBeIN has demanded Arabsat remove the rogue channels Arabsat  through the United Statesbased law firm Squire Patton Boggs  refused It said the customer who bought the satellite space denied being involved in beoutQThe beIN antipiracy team believes it knows how beoutQ is stealing the signal Essentially the website is reairing content delivered to an individual subscriber Since each subscriber has a unique identification number that is usually visible known as a fingerprint beIN engineers thought they would be able to easily identify the offending customer However the pirates have figured out how to hide their fingerprintsTheres nothing else like it in the world Esteban Israel beINs executive director of technology said of beoutQs level of sophistication We work with all the top technology vendors technology developers We have our experts we deploy state of the art technologies and we have not seen this anywhere elseAs beINs engineers search for a way to stop the piracy beoutQ is flourishing At the start of the Champions League game between AS Roma and Liverpool beINs Keaveny noticed the logo for the forthcoming Russia World Cup had been added alongside beoutQs A halftime promotion promised beoutQs subscribers that they would see all 64 World Cup games live The commentary and studio analysis on beoutQ broadcasts are usually from beINFIFA and other governing bodies that have sold exclusive broadcast rights to beIN have supported the companys antipiracy efforts but have generally chosen not to criticize Saudi Arabia A group that has offered to invest 25 billion to start two new tournaments with FIFA includes Saudi investors La Liga Spains top soccer league recently signed a lucrative sponsorship deal to loan to top Spanish teams players from Saudi Arabias World Cup squadSophie Jordan the Parisbased general counsel for beINs parent company said turning a blind eye toward piracy risked devaluing the rightsThe rights holders need to be very careful she said By the time they realize this imperils the value of the rights in the region and not stimulate competition as some might believe it will be too lateBeIN has filed complaints with the World Trade Organization and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation which includes both Saudi Arabia and Qatar But legal time is different to business time Jordan said We are losing money every day We will prevail but we will prevail in three or even five yearsAt beINs headquarters the control room was still buzzing on the night of Liverpools Champions League victory as midnight neared The broadcasters director of programming Duncan Walkinshaw imagined what resources beoutQ must have to be able to push out someone elses channels and even give them their own commercial breaks By the end of the week more than 50 live games had been broadcast by beoutQTheyve created a brand without any acquisitions he said Its quite extraordinary and very wrong Were investing our time and effort and someone is stealing it and making it their ownBen Hubbard contributed reporting from BeirutAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY

tournamentsIt could be as simple as going fishing every day the 70yearold Payne said with a chuckleNot to worryWhile his name doesnt roll off the tongue of the average fan nothing more is needed to assure that William Porter Payne will go down as one of the most influential people in modern American sportsHe almost singlehandedly pulled off an upset that ranks right up there with Buster Douglas knocking out Mike Tyson Even now more than two decades later it seems almost surreal that Payne persuaded the International Olympic Committee to give the 100th anniversary edition of its Summer Games to Atlanta  a city with no discernible character outside of CocaCola Waffle House and the eternal gridlock of its freewaysNot far behind on the improbability scale As head of Augusta National Golf Club Payne finally dragged the home of the Masters into the 21st century by opening the doors to female membersLove him hate him or wonder who were talking about here theres no denying those are quite a pair of achievements to have on a resumeHe was great about taking on challenges and putting himself in a leadership role and then being able to learn as he went said Vince Dooley who was Paynes coach when he played college football at the University of Georgia in the late 1960s Its an inspiration of courage to do what hes been able to doPayne was back at his alma mater on Monday feted by a host of luminaries during a ceremony to name the schools new indoor athletic facility in honor of him and his late father Porter Otis Payne who also played football for the Bulldogs shortly after World War IISixtime Masters winner Jack Nicklaus was there So was former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young a key ally in Paynes quixotic quest for the 1996 OlympicsIn some ways the night was like a life coming full circleDooley after all was one of the first people to hear of Paynes preposterous notion to bring the Olympics to AtlantaIll never forget it because he stuttered around it a little bit and then finally I said What is on your mind Dooley recalled He said Coach I have saved enough money I am going to bring the Olympics to Atlanta Georgia And Im thinking at the time Atlanta Georgia Who knew where Atlanta was internationally at the timeOnce he landed the games against all odds Payne was ridiculed for the way he pulled it offSome of the criticism was deservedSome of it not so muchPaynes biggest regret will always be the tragic bombing that rocked Centennial Olympic Park midway through the games There were welldocumented issues with transportation which hell sort of acknowledge And hell always have to answer for Izzy the ridiculous computergenerated mascot But Payne will never go along with those detractors who say his Olympics were an overcommercialized downright tacky spectacle more comparable to a county fair than one of the worlds greatest sporting eventsThe criticism of the games was very superficial he says as feisty now as he was 22 years ago A couple of transportation issues The other ones were not even substantive When you have the audacity to undertake something that big criticism is a part of it Theres never been an Olympic games that didnt have similar criticism It had no lasting effect on me at allWhether or not his detractors have a point this much is clearPayne managed to pull off the Olympics without saddling Atlanta with billions of dollars in taxpayer debt which has pretty much been the fate for every Olympic city since then His were the last games  probably for all time  to be paid for almost entirely with private funding They may not have been the most elegant of games but they didnt break the bank or leave behind a bunch of crumbling white elephant arenasThats not a bad legacy eitherThis was an opportunity for us to truly introduce the American South to the rest of the world Payne said I think we did that very positively and very effectively While several Olympic venues faded away  the main stadium is still there serving for 20 years as the baseball home of the Atlanta Braves before it was turned over to Georgia State Universitys fledgling football program Just this past weekend it hosted a Foo Fighters concertBut Centennial Olympic Park  which was a brainchild of Paynes to give Atlanta the focal point it was lacking  is the most lasting landmark of Billys Games now flanked by the mammoth Georgia Aquarium the World of CocaCola a civil rights museum the College Football Hall of Fame and a towering Ferris wheelA decade after the Olympics Payne was appointed chairman of Augusta NationalHis impact it turned out was just as profound  He transformed the look of the venerable club with a series of massive building projects He launched amateur tournaments in Asia and Latin America to expand the international market He founded a drive chip and putt competition for young playersBut most significantly he quietly did away with the clubs ban on female members in 2012 which his predecessor Hootie Johnson had defiantly proclaimed would never happen at the point of a bayonetNext year for the first time the Masters will host a womens amateur tournament All our lady members are great and I suspect Fred Ridley his successor as chairman will continue the momentum that we have established over the past several years Payne saidThe Olympics in AtlantaFemale members at Augusta

for his induction into the Aspen Hall of Fame in 2004 I cried all night longBill Marolt a member of the Colorado ski team told The Denver Post in 2012 that Mr Beattie was a tough relentless coachYou had to be prepared because it was tough love said Mr Marolt who later served for 20 years as chief executive of the US Ski and Snowboard Association Lots of guys and gals dont respond to that But that was his style personality and I loved itMr Beatties success at Colorado led to his being named coach of the United States ski team The job involved turning what had been a collection of athletes who assembled periodically for Olympics and world championships into a standing national team that had training camps and traveled the worldIt scored some successes at the 1964 Winter Games in Innsbruck where Billy Kidd and Jimmie Heuga won silver and bronze medals respectively in mens slalom and Jean Saubert won a silver medal in womens giant slalom and a bronze in slalomThis is the greatest day for Olympic skiing Mr Beattie said at the time These boys are young There will be a lot moreBut there was not The Americans with Kidd and Heuga returning did not win any medals at the 1968 Games in Grenoble France Skiing events that year were dominated by Frances JeanClaude Killy who won gold medals in downhill giant slalom and slalomMr Beattie left the team soon after upset with restrictions against skiers earning prize money his son said In 1970 he formed the World Pro Ski Tour which he ran for about a dozen years The tour gave skiers the freedom they had lacked under amateur rules The tours innovations included headtohead competition in the form of dual racing in which two skiers went down a slalom or giant slalom course sidebysideIt was fun to be in charge of your own life Mr Kidd told The Post in 2012 about the pro tour You decided if you wanted to go to that race how much you wanted to train and how much you wanted to train with Spider Sabich the night before the raceVladimir Sabich who was known as Spider was on the US Ski team when Mr Beattie was its coach he later raced on the pro circuitIn addition to his son and brother Mr Beattie is survived by his wife Marci Cohen his daughter Susan Crabtree six grandchildren and eight greatgrandchildren His marriages to Ann Dwinnell Kiki Cutter and Cheryl Britton ended in divorceAlthough Mr Beattie and Mr Giffords call of Klammers victorious race in 1976 appeared to be live it was not Mr Gifford recalled It was recorded several hours after the race during the editingAfter the race Mr Gifford said he and Mr Beattie were quickly caught up in the celebration of Klammers winWe joined in on the schnapps and everything else he said and we realized we had to go back to the studio to do the

AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsWhen a 35yearold named Sam Hinkie became president and general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers in 2013 the team was a middling NBA franchise whose city like most cities felt it had won fewer titles than it deserved One route to actually winning those titles seemed clear NBA championships are won by teams with a superstar and preferably two or three The most efficient way to secure such superstars is through the annual draft And the drafts rules give an advantage to the teams with the worst records As Hinkie took the reins fans quickly concluded that he was preparing to attempt a novel strategy The Sixers would tank deliberately fielding poor teams whose bottomoftheleague finishes would net them high draft picks This would take a while to bring positive results but Hinkie implored fans to ignore the teams losses and look at the big picture We talk a lot about process he said not outcomeSports are defined by clear rules predictable mechanics and unambiguous results you really can devise a workable system around them The same goes for a game like blackjack in which your chances are consistent the dealers behavior is printed right on the table and everyone agrees on what makes a good outcome The odds may be against you  casinos are after all a business  but there really is an objectively correct way to play many hands Even when you lose the process remains soundReal life is not at all like blackjack and yet the same faith in process crops up in even the messiest realms Late last year a White House spokesman dismissed fears over Robert Muellers investigation by suggesting that the administration should be as sanguine as one of its lawyers Take a deep breath follow Ty Cobbs lead trust the process Anthony Scaramucci during his abbreviated reign as White House communications director argued for a health care system that would trust the process of the free market like in telecom like in airlines  those industries of notoriously satisfied consumers Two years ago a New Yorker article mentioned one person who adopted a trust the process mantra while taking an improv class he left his career in venture capital and got into a Buddhist podcastProcess can be soothing We defer to it almost out of habit as if it is a machine that will resolve all conflicts so long as we can resist meddling with its workings But what if those workings and the conflicts behind them are precisely what we should be meddling with and arguing overAmong the United States most cherished processes is the one enshrined in the Fifth Amendment and later the Fourteenth No person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law The set of rights weve come to think of as due process is process at its best offering a whole litany of protections designed to minimize wrongful convictions presumption of innocence the right to an attorney the requirement that guilt be proved to an exceptionally high standard Our generous conception of due process is a source of national pride  so much so that we sometimes come to expect it in every area of lifeFor the past several months this has been the question raised as men are accused of sexual misbehavior or misconduct What kind of process might the accused be owed before suffering any consequences  especially if those consequences are as informal as having people generally despise you or demand your resignation from a highprofile job This is an open and debatable question and there are people in a position to propose concrete answers to it And yet weve often seen them call for process as a way to avoid taking any clear position When a White House adviser Rob Porter resigned amid reports of domestic abuse President Trump tweeted Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process But he was not to all appearances suggesting that Porter be tried in a court of law  and if Porter deserved some formal hearing before departing his job surely it was the Trump administration itself that would have to provide itLate last November as pressure built on Representative John Conyers to resign over accusations of sexual harassment the House minority leader Nancy Pelosi appeared on Meet the Press and maintained that we are strengthened by due process When asked how she might use her own powers to address the situation  she could for instance have suspended him from his ranking position on the House Judiciary Committee  she declined to give an answerInvoking process lets us delegate our own judgments to some ostensibly neutral mechanism a system that will formally decide things that might be difficult for us to decide ourselves But it can also absolve us of the responsibility to engage with the questions around us it can offer us cover for taking the positions we wanted to all along Columbia University for instance has declined to negotiate with a union formed by its graduate students even after that union was approved by the National Labor Relations Board and voted on by the students themselves  a stance that will push the matter into further litigation We have declined to bargain the universitys provost said in January until the legal process has been allowed to run its course This is one kind of language process can speak Sorry it seems to say Our hands are tied Were forced to let this play out in precisely the way we already preferredBut process is not a magical ritual  it is designed to accomplish something specific and if it fails it can be redesigned Of the 17 constitutional amendments ratified since the Bill of Rights 10 have changed the rules of voting and representation And after Humphrey was defeated by Richard Nixon the Democrats found themselves revisiting their primary system a commission led by Donald Fraser and George McGovern a peacenik senator from South Dakota proposed changes to the primaries that would transfer power from party bosses to the rank and file Three presidential elections later after the candidates this new system encouraged including McGovern failed to thrive Democrats changed the rules again swinging authority back to party loyalists with the creation of superdelegatesIn 2016 those superdelegates came to seem to supporters of an insurgent Bernie Sanders like an emblem of the party establishments preference for the presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton At the party convention the Democratic National Committee created another commission to examine voting processes It issued its recommendations late in 2017 including measures like drastically reducing the number of superdelegates and opening caucuses to absentee participationMany in the party have joined in support of these changes No less than Tim Kaine  Clintons handpicked running mate  tweeted early this month We Democrats need to do away with superdelegates once and for all They are given undue influence and make the presidential nominating process less democratic But even explaining those recommendations might require for some audiences the gauzy reassurance that the status quo wont be upset too much One commission member Jan Bauer told The Des Moines Register

AdvertisementSupported byPhys EdA banana might reasonably replace sports drinks for those of us who rely on carbohydrates to fuel exercise and speed recovery according to a new study comparing the cellular effects of carbohydrates consumed during sportsIt found that a banana with its allnatural package provides comparable or greater antiinflammatory and other benefits for athletes than sports drinks But there may be a downside and it involves bloatingFor decades athletes and their advisers have believed and studies have confirmed that eating or drinking carbohydrates during prolonged exertion can enable someone to continue for longer or at higher intensities and recover more quickly afterward than if he or she does not eat during the workoutThe carbohydrates rapidly fuel muscles lessening some of the physiological stress of working out and prompting less inflammation afterwardThe most digestible and portable form of carbohydrates is sugar whether glucose fructose or sucrose and for athletes this sugar frequently is provided through sports drinksBut sports drinks are not a substance found in the natural world They are manufactured and can contain flavorings and chemicals that some people might wish to avoidSo a few years ago researchers at the North Carolina Research Campus of Appalachian State University in Kannapolis began to wonder about fruits as a healthier alternative to sports drinks during exerciseMost fruits including bananas are sugary and high in fructose fructose after all means fruit sugar But they also contain other natural substances that might have an impact on sport performance and recovery the researchers speculatedBut that study had left many questions unanswered particularly about whether and how the carbohydrates might be aiding athletes recoveryDole Foods which sells bananas partially funded both studies According to a statement in the study the company did not have any involvement in the study design data collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscriptThe researchers asked 20 competitive cyclists male and female to complete a grueling 47mile 75kilometer bike ride on several occasions at the campus performance lab During one ride they drank only water In the others they had water but also eight ounces of a sports drink or about half of a banana every 30 minutesThe scientists drew blood before the workout immediately after and at several additional points stretching out to 45 hours laterThey then checked the blood for markers of inflammation and levels of hundreds of molecules known as metabolites that can change during and after exertion and signify how much stress the body feelsThey also isolated blood cells to look at the activity of certain genes involved in inflammationAs they had expected the scientists found that swallowing only water resulted in relatively high levels of inflammatory markers in the riders blood These markers were much lower if the cyclists had consumed fruit or the sports drinkThe volunteers also showed lessstressed metabolite profiles if they had had carbohydrates during their rides whether those calories had come from a bottle or a bananaBut there were differences in the activity of some genes In particular the scientists found that the riders blood cells produced less of a genetic precursor of an enzyme known as COX2 if they had eaten bananas during their workout This effect was not seen if they had drunk the sports drink or only waterThe COX2 enzyme prompts the production of prostaglandins which in turn intensify inflammation Less of the genetic precursor in cells after a workout should mean less COX2 and reduced inflammation says David Nieman the director of the human performance lab at Appalachian State University and the studys lead authorHe points out that antiinflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen work by inhibiting COX2 but until now researchers had not considered that bananas might perform comparablyHow the fruit manages to affect the cells gene expression after exercise is still not known however he saysHe and his colleagues also do not know whether half of a standard banana every 30 minutes is the ideal amount of the fruit during exertion Although it provided as many carbohydrates as in a cup of the sports drink it also resulted in quite a bit of bloating he says which might dampen some athletes enthusiasmHe and his colleagues plan to explore those issues in future studies and also look into the effects of other fruits Dates have even more sugar than bananas Dr Nieman saysIn the meantime he says for exercisers who might prefer a natural inexpensive and neatly packaged alternative to sports drinks bananas look pretty goodAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,sports

reward has been glib condescension from the boomer press Rising to our defense is Harris our peer born 1988 as the books cover notes a familiar provocateur from the internets left flank Harris contends that America has stiffed our generation filling childhoods with homework and extracurricular activities All of this ostensibly served to prepare us for college and fruitful careers when really all it resulted in was the almost inevitable heartbreak of falling short of our parents expectations and oursHarris spins a recognizable story of a hostile job market characterized by declines in worker solidarity and wages He uses the concept of human capital to analyze how much time millennials have invested in themselves by way of schoolwork And for what Every authority from moms to presidents told millennials to accumulate as much human capital as we could and we did but the market hasnt held up its end of the bargainHe brings a fresh contrarian eye to some of the usual data points He sees in the Obamaera nationalization of student debt not an aid to youngsters but a goofy scheme to stimulate consumer demand For rising tuition costs at Americas public universities he blames greedy administrators rather than benighted state legislatures He argues that millennials deserved loot has been hoarded by the ownership class and seniors who have saved entitlement programs that serve them as steady government jobs disappear and the social safety net withers He also broadens his survey to cover school discipline and YouTube stars And he makes a surprising case that sexting isnt as harmful as its cracked up to beAs generational advocates go we could do worse than Harris But he ends his book with a fatalism nearly as flippant as the generational critiques he loathes Despite this moment of political fellowship among millennials he writes off the possibility of meaningful change coming from government or social movements once we take over Im not optimistic

who struggle to be represented in the media ecosystem she mentions transpeople and agoraphobes And not all selfietakers she proves are as oblivious as imaginedUnfortunately Elers book would have benefited from a more careful edit Her discursive style is sometimes whimsical but mostly distracting She dwells on a topic having little to do with selfies and then glosses over complicated selfierelated stories Fake news in the 2016 election gets at least seven pages the macaque who took a selfie and then saw PETA sue for his copyright gets just two She provides an extended discussion of blogs that post screenshots of bad Tinder conversations but glosses over the July 2016 Facebook Live stream by Diamond Reynolds after her husband Philando Castile was shot by the police And while there are moments where her light touch suits the material well a section on socialmedia surveillance at Standing Rock is hindered by her choice to discuss it through quoting a meeting she had over coffee with a protesterIn spite of its flaws though Elers book alights on the source of the selfies power It is the easiest way to assert ones humanity in our hypernetworked world Perhaps our muchfussedover narcissism is not a flaw but a survival tacticHer new iGen pities rather than disdains those born after 1995 arguing that smartphone addiction has saddled a new generation with profound psychological problems including sleep deprivation depression and unshakable senses of loneliness and fear They drink less and have less sex they socialize less without their parents present they

highlight smartphones contributions to our malaise In one section she notes the feeling of rejection that arises from a text sent without an immediate response and in another she notes that more screen time leads to less inperson socializing which breeds lonelinessShe could stand to incorporate some of Harriss alarm about the economy She duly recognizes income inequality as a prime source of iGens anxiety about its future But while she discusses how smartphones do their harm she has no such harsh words for the modern labor market Instead she tells marketers how to exploit iGens diminished

whisperer He worked a little magic as the rookie coach of the Memphis Grizzlies in the 201617 season before his team ran upon a reef of injuries and an aging star started to grumble and the coach was tossed into the roiling sea He is well regarded by some of the best coaches in this league such as the Warriors Steve Kerr and the Heats Erik SpoelstraFizdale might turn the Knicks into a recognizable NBA team if he survives next season and the season after that Organizational pathology has been the problem The Knicks whether out of despair or boredom devour coaches Fizdale will be the Knicks 12th coach in 18 seasonsIn 2015 Phil Jackson of not terribly blessed memory drafted Kristaps Porzingis During a tenure as team president that was desultory in nearly every respect this was Jacksons single brilliant actBlessed with a spectacular talent a 7foot3 hybrid of a shooting guard and a pterodactyl defender most teams would craft a team and organizational philosophy around him The Golden State Warriors built a magnificent jazz band around their transcendent point guard Stephen Curry The Houston Rockets have crafted a score and score again machine around two great guards James Harden and Chris Paul The Philadelphia 76ers are building out from the twin foundation stones of Joel Embiid and point guard Ben SimmonsThese teams have mostly put an emphasis on finding prime coaching talents and leaving them aloneThe Knicks have traveled a different road as gravel turns to dirt turns to a hazily indistinct foot path In his rookie year Porzingis was coached by Derek Fisher who knew not so much about coaching and used a day off to travel to a party in Los Angeles where he rumbled with his girlfriends exboyfriend The Knicks fired Fisher and replaced him with Kurt Rambis whose next success as a pro coach will be his first He insisted that more or less everything Fisher had told Porzingis was wrong and that the Latvian should play closer to the basketRambis was 919 in a mercifully abbreviated tenure Jackson next brought in Hornacek in whom some hoops aficionados claimed to divine an inspired offensive coach You wait those aficionados said byebye triangle offense Jeff is going modern NBA offenseThis did not happen Porzingis blew out his knee this season and Hornacek coached out the remaining months as a Dead Coach Walking The Knicks in instinctively classy fashion fired him in a rentaconferenceroom at Westchester County Airport at 2 am just after the Knicks returned from their season finale in ClevelandEnter the DragonJames L Dolan the Knicks owner has presided as the Grandmaster of Chaos that has been the Knicks for two decades now Of late the past few years he made a show of proclaiming that he would lift his heavy hand hire good people and let them do good things and all thatI think Hornacek had the same kind of issue that Phil did in that he didnt grasp how different the players are now in the way they think and deal with management and the coaches Dolan said I think he was way behind on thatSpeaking of way behind on that Dolan handed out 65 million in contracts to Jackson and Hornacek a fact for which their wealth management teams are deeply gratefulEven in the rubble of the Knicks there are building materials to be found The rookie point guard the smoothfaced teenager Frank Ntilikina showed flashes here and there of the instincts needed to guide a team and he played surprisingly sturdy defense Trey Burke a midseason refuse heap find looked as if he was capable of playing explosive minutes off the bench They will have a lottery pick in the coming NBA draftAnd there is Porzingis who inshallah will return healthy at some point next season and resume his upward arc Fizdale has talked of traveling to Europe to establish a relationship with the man who more than anyone else will determine his fate as coach of the KnicksAs Ive spent an unfortunate number of decades following this franchise and my sons have obtained no return on years of passionate rooting I wish Fizdale nothing but the best just as I wish the Knicks management team nothing but patience with its new coachIn that regard a word about the unsettling rumors that the Knicks management harbors a daydream of trading on Fizdales Miamiborn friendliness with James and attracting the great one to New York City this summer This is like panning for gold in Central ParkYou can knock yourself out shaking that pan aint nothing there but fools goldAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,sports

AdvertisementSupported byAnalysisLast week track and fields world governing body limited entry into womens events to athletes who have testosterone levels that are capable of being produced solely by ovariesUnderstanding the rules and why they make sense is hard They are based in biology people dont know or dont like to talk about and lets be honest at least in some circles theyre politically incorrect They force us to talk about womens bodies when it is increasingly taboo to do so and they run counter to the movement that seeks to include transgender and intersex people in social institutions based on their gender identity rather than their biologyThese are important progressive developments but their effects on valuable institutions like womens sport are real and they need to be understood before positions harden on bad information Pretending that the female body doesnt exist or that we cant define the boundaries between mens and womens bodies is a bad idea for many reasons Replacing traditional sex classifications with classifications based on gender identity certainly has steep costs in contexts like competitive sport where the likelihood of success is precisely about sexspecific biologyA lot has been written about intersex athletes who identify  or are identified in their legal documents  as women What is important to know is that there are many different intersex conditions but the IAAF is only concerned with the subset that involves athletes who are biologically male They are in between only with respect to the prebirth underdevelopment of their external genitals Intersex athletes who are biologically female arent affected by the rulesSpecifically the athletes who are the focus of the IAAFs rules are those who have testes Starting in puberty and as adults their testes produce sperm not eggs and supply testosterone in quantities that biologically female bodies and their ovaries never come close to producingThe male range at its lowest is three times higher than the female range at its highest At puberty these athletes developed male not female secondary sex characteristics increased muscle mass and strength including increased heart size higher hemoglobin levels which result in better oxygen carrying capacity and different muscle types and ratios of fat to muscleAdvocates for intersex athletes like to say that sex doesnt divide neatly This may be true in gender studies departments but at least for competitive sports purposes they are simply wrong Sex in this context is easy to define and the lines are cleanly drawn You either have testes and testosterone in the male range or you dont As the IAAFs rules provide a simple testosterone test establishes this fact one way or the otherTestosterone throughout the life cycle including puberty is the reason the best elite females are not competitive in competition against elite males This 10 to 12percent sexbased performance gap is well documented by sports and exercise scientists alike But it isnt the most important performance gap Rather thats the mundane fact that many nonelite males routinely outperform the best elite femalesEach year the worlds best time in the womens marathon is surpassed by hundreds of men The womens world records in all of the races on the track from 100 meters to 10000 meters are also surpassed by many men each year including by many high school boys For example in 2017 36 boys ran faster than Florence Griffith Joyners seemingly unassailable 100meter record of 1049There is no characteristic that matters more than testes and testosterone Pick your body part your geography and your socioeconomic status and do your comparative homework Starting in puberty there will always be boys who can beat the best girls and men who can beat the best womenBecause of this without a womens category based on sex or at least these sexlinked traits girls and women would not have the chance they have now to develop their athletic talents and reap the many benefits of participating and winning in sports and competition Eric Vilain a geneticist who specializes in differences of sex development has been blunt about it removing sex from the eligibility rules would be a disaster for womens sport  a sad end to what feminists have wanted for so longThis may sound like hyperbole but it isnt In competitive sport winning and room at the top are what ultimately matter so relative numbers are irrelevant It doesnt matter that there are 100 females and three males in a girls race if the three males win spots in the final or on the podium because they are males The unusually high incidence of intersex athletes in the womens middle distances and their reported 100 percent win share in the womens 800 meters at the Olympic Games in Rio show their disproportionate power Indeed it is because they clustered in the middle distances that these events are the initial focus of the rules Their supremacy was proof of principle Testosterone readings outside of the female range were also found in the throws but these were attributed to doping not intersex conditionsThe IAAF is requiring that affected athletes lower their testosterone levels to within the female range if they want to continue competing in the middle distances in the womens category By definition the required hormone therapy causes medically unnecessary physiological change and no one should be forced to take drugs they dont want or needBut the IAAFs requirement isnt rogue or reckless It simply adopts the standard of care in transition medicine which is very much embraced by those who seek to match their bodies to their gender identity Intersex athletes who have gone through puberty may not want to drop their testosterone levels to female levels if they dont identify as female or dont see the need to feminize their bodies for reasons other than sport This is especially true for athletes who are in the game to win rather than to express themselves through participation as women This is properly their choice and its a real oneWhen were not focused on intersex athletes we tend to understand the fact of sex differences and their relevance In the United States those differences are the basis for Title IX and its hugely popular mandate that separate and equal funding be set aside for girls and womens sport Under Title IX sex remains the principal and generally uncontroversial basis for classification and legal protectionsGiven this the compromise reflected in the IAAFs rules is significant Using testosterone as a proxy for sex may seem like subterfuge but its not If it were really sex that mattered and not testosterone then athletes who had gone through puberty as biological males would be categorically banned from the womens category as they used to be Instead today if their legal documents identify them as women they can compete as women in the events they prefer if they transition the single sex trait that determines capacity for the win They can keep their bodies otherwise intact The process offers fairness both to the affected athletes and to the fieldDoriane Lambelet Coleman competed in track and field internationally during the 1980s and is a professor of law at Duke Law SchoolAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,sports

AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesWASHINGTON  In recent months the United States has punished the following people for alleged human rights violations and corruptionA former Gambian president who led terror and assassination squads A Chechen leader involved in torture kidnapping and murder A Pakistani man at the center of a humanorgan trafficking networkAnd a former Russian sports minister who was implicated in a nations systematic doping scheme that tainted several Olympics and other international competitionsWell not the last person  at least not yetThe United States AntiDoping Agency is exploring the use of government sanctions to punish Russian officials involved in the statesupported doping program that turned the 2014 Sochi Games into a sham On Tuesday Travis Tygart the chief executive of the agency attended a workshop here sponsored by the US Helsinki Commission to see if the Global Magnitsky Act a 2016 law that allows the sanctions could apply to the RussiansThe law calls for individuals who have committed human rights violations or significant corruption to be barred from obtaining United States visas and blocked from using the American financial system which effectively blacklists them from doing business with major world banks Powerful wealthy people dont like to have their assets frozenWhat happened in Sochi was the worst case of corruption that weve ever seen in sport so why shouldnt the act apply to us Tygart said We have to look down every avenue if were working for clean athletes particularly in light of the IOCs failure do anythingTygart said American athletes have been demanding that the antidoping agency find ways to better protect clean athletes in the future so the Russian doping debacle is never repeatedThe International Olympic Committee punished Russia sort of for its widespread doping It barred the Russian Olympic Committee the Russian flag and the Russian national anthem from last months Pyeongchang Games while letting some Russian athletes compete under a neutral flag It also barred for life one top Russian official Vitaly Mutko He was implicated in the doping program as the Russian sports minister After the scheme was exposed he was promoted to deputy prime ministerSo the United States antidoping group is looking for additional ways to punish the Russians The Global Magnitsky Act is in its infancy and the sports angle might be a longshot but why not tryBesides the United States government often has to do the dirty work for sports leagues and federations that refuse to police themselvesTo take down the principles and athletes involved in the Bay Area Laboratory CoOperative steroids scandal that ensnared athletes like Barry Bonds and Marion Jones law enforcement made arrests and prosecutors took it from there To address the widespread doping problem in Major League Baseball Congress had to drag players and management in to testifyTo uncover corruption in FIFA United States prosecutors took the lead and indicted more than two dozen officials and businessmen from all over the world  much to the dismay of soccers global establishmentAnd now it could be the Global Magnitsky Act that delivers a staggering blow to the Russians for corrupting the results of major global sports competitions  including but certainly not limited to the OlympicsDoes such sports corruption rise to the level covered by the law William F Browder thinks so Hes a prominent investor who worked with Congress on the original Magnitsky Act which was passed in 2012 in response to the death of Browders Russian lawyer Sergei L Magnitsky The lawyer had uncovered a 230 million taxtheft scheme before he was arrested and died in prisonTheres one important issue and thats the doping scandal at the Sochi Games led to what I believe were murders Browder said referring to two officials from Russias antidoping agency who died within two weeks of each other in 2016 There were a number of people involved who died very suspiciously who were most likely liquidated to cover up a crimeHe added There were people who effectively ruined institution of sport and have committed crimes to do so That would reach the standard of Global Magnitsky in my opinion These people involved in sports doping theyre shameless So there needs to be really hard consequences They need to pay a very dear priceThat price would be losing access to their money and the freedom to move about the world And they would be on a list with some of the worlds worst criminalsIf the Olympic Games are unquestionably tainted that has huge economic ramifications for not just US athletes but for US industry and the US government has an interest in making sure that doesnt happen said Robert G Berschinski senior vice president for policy at Human Rights First and a former deputy assistant secretary of stateI asked him if he thought the individuals involved in the Russian doping case could be sanctioned under the law Without getting into specifics he said it seems that you can make a caseTygart thinks so too He left the workshop on Tuesday thinking that sanctions were a last resort but a viable optionIs it truly a viable option and will the antidoping agency act on itA certain group of Russians might not be eager to learn the answersEmail julietnytimescomAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,sports
AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesPYEONGCHANG South Korea  You know what grabs your attention at big air snowboarding at the Olympics When the announcer introduces the first rider like soCheryl Maas Coming back from a broken neckThe announcer went on to say that Maas who is 33 and from the Netherlands had been struggling with bruised heels before coming to Pyeongchang but to be honest all I could hear was broken neck My 6yearold daughter who has been watching the Olympics just told me that snowboarding was her new favorite sport and that she loved big air YikesSo how do parents deal with their children doing this intensely daredevil sport where broken bones are common I thought Id askLisbeth and Peter Gasser the parents of the gold medal favorite Anna Gasser from Austria take opposite approaches Lisbeths knees go weak when she sees Anna compete and with good reason In addition to damaging two vertebrae in her neck Anna 26 has banged up various other parts of her body  a knee a tibia a heel an ankleShes my girl so of course I worry but I never let her see it Lisbeth Gasser said When she was home for two months with the neck injury I just asked Anna do you want to keep going Is this worth it for you and she said yes So that was the end of the conversationYet Anna Gasser said that every time she called home at an unexpected moment her mother was quick to say Are you OK Are you injuredWhen I asked Peter Gasser how he remained calm during big air competitions a family friend blurted out TranquilizersLauren Anderson whose 27yearold daughter Jamie won her second gold medal in slopestyle last week said she wasnt one bit nervous that Jamie was now competing in the big air event as well Even though Jamie has already broken her collarbone and pelvis and once ruptured her spleenLauren Anderson has eight children and raises alpacas on a farm in Vermont She said she encouraged her children to learn from the heart and from the friendly universe and not necessarily from schoolbooksWhen you have so many kids you have to let them fall down and pick themselves up she said And I also think its always going to be what its going to be so why dont you just relax and watch the showI also approached Laura and Brook Corning the parents of 18yearold Chris Corning who is from Colorado and among the worlds topranked snowboardersHis parents said they trusted that their son was both athletic and skillful enough to make big air not as perilous as it might seemChris Cornings whole life has been filled with what his parents call calculated risk At 3 he was already a skateboarder with homemade ramps in their basement At 7 he was a snowboarder He once broke his thumb when it got stuck in a corrugated pipe in a snowboard park He played football in high school too but eventually went just with snowboarding because the schedules conflictedBesides Laura Corning said football is dangerousMastering big air is all about starting small and making incremental improvements as a snowboarder the Cornings said First you try a half turn then a full turn Then eventually youre hitting 1080s and more Its how big air eventually doesnt seem like a big dealWhat you want to do is just put Bubble Wrap on them because you dont want to see them get hurt or go through the pain Laura Corning said But you cant Thats just not the best way to raise a childFor Laura Corning a court reporter this has been a learned mindset Brook Corning a mechanical engineer is the one with risktaking in his genesOnce when Chris was about 9 his father took him backcountry snowboarding Brook Corning said that he had to sign about a billion waivers before they could go and that he had to strap a beacon onto Chris so the boy could be found in an avalanche They were also given shovels and probes in case they needed to dig outWhen we were hiking across a knifes edge and there were cliffs on both sides I thought Hmm maybe this really isnt a good idea Brook Corning said But at the end of the day we had so much fun Ive always trusted Chriss athletic ability Its astoundingHowever when they came home exhausted and described where they had been Laura Corning was furiousI just lost it and might have said a few curse words she said Basically Ive been prepped for this big air and all that crazy stuff my entire parenthoodA parenthood that sometimes means watching her son hobbling away after a jump or even being taken off the slope on a stretcher In December Chris Corning qualified for the Olympics despite hip and back injuries and he gingerly stepped onto the podium afterwardWhen he competes Laura Corning said she prays God please keep him safe angels wings angels wings she repeats to herselfThat nervous scene is partly why Cheryl Maas the Dutch big air rider coming off a broken neck doesnt want her parents watching her competeHer mother she said freaks out quite a bit a reaction that was especially intense after Maass crash at a World Cup event in Germany in 2016 I broke my face she said And I think that scared her a lotBut there is another reason Maas doesnt want her parents around  so she can skip worrying about themIts always like are they having a good time how are they dealing with the mix of culture are they able to get a bus did they make it on the bus Maas said I dont want to think about thatMaybe too theres just a little less for Maass parents to worry about than I first thought When the announcer mentioned Maass broken neck he didnt bother to say that she hadnt hurt it while competingIt actually happened on a vacation in Cyprus where Maas dove into a shallow hotel poolPeople can get hurt doing just about anything Still deciding whether Ill tell my daughter thatAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,sports

officer said We caught him with heroinZach was given a nineyear prison sentenceTheres a whole correlation between him and me getting this job Morrison told his players during that summer speech Because of him Ive gained 60 70 younger brothers and I want to keep you from doing the things he didI want to save you from thatSome Cubs players told me Morrison should be meaner He could push them harder make them run more hills Maybe he could curse a littleMorrison believes he has to be careful about how much he pushes his players because hes afraid theyll quit Sometimes hes a father figure sometimes a task master But its imperative that he doesnt scare players awayId rather focus on the kids than the wins he told me because I see what can happen to kids who strayHe saw it with a player expected to be the starting quarterback That player the best athlete on the team strayedHe could throw a ball with his left hand in a perfect spiral more than 30 yards farther than other guys would throw with their dominant hand said James Lee an assistant coach and a Madison police officer Theres no doubt he couldve played Division I  if he hadnt melted downThe player stopped coming to practices He was suspended from school and later showed up on a missingperson report A day before I met Morrison the player had been escorted from school after being caught with pillsIts crushing when you strike out with a player said Morrison a middle school technology teacher If they have something else going on like another activity then it can be OK But if they have nothing else thats what worries me Its the downtime that worries meAnother player who quit the team eventually dropped out of school and vanished Morrison later saw a newspaper article about the playerThe police had found the player passed out in a car with a marijuana blunt and a pocketful of prescription pills including Clonazepam an antiseizure and antianxiety drug Promethazine an allergy and motion sickness drug and Trazodone an antidepressant He said the methamphetamine pipe in the car wasnt his because he only snorted the drugAs Morrison told me about that player a text from Lee the assistant coach popped up on his cellphone It was a warningLee advised Morrison to be aware of students with gummy bears because they could be laced with a synthetic stimulant called flakka known to cause violent behavior The text said the candy was usually individually wrapped stickier than normalMorrison could only sighI never did drugs not once and used to look down on people who use drugs but now I have empathy for them after what happened to my brother he said I cant just look away I want them to do better Its opened my eyesIts a good thing that winning isnt the only thing for the Madison Cubs because their prospects for it werent great last seasonWith the loss of that star who quit school and the loss of the next quarterback to a knee injury during basketball season the Cubs were looking at starting a thirdstring quarterbackBut a reminder of the true value of participating in sports  as defined by Morrison  showed up at practice in JulyCurry Morgan a 2015 Madison graduate had returned from college to visit He wanted to thank his former coach Morgan is a junior biology and neuroscience major at Indiana UniversityPurdue University Indianapolis on an academic scholarship with plans for medical schoolHis father was out of his life by the time he was in kindergarten His brother was addicted to pills and sold drugs His mother died of liver disease two days before his senior year The day of the funeral Morrison ended practice early and dispatched buses of teammates so they could support MorganAfterward when Morgan didnt have a place to live teammates offered couches At graduation Morrison collected money to pay for Morgans cap and gown and class ringI was scared people would treat me differently because of my family circumstances but Coach Morrison he wouldnt let that happen Morgan said Sports is the reason Im resilient Its the reason Im where I am and not selling drugs right nowEyes wet he buried his face in his hands It has been an especially rough year for him he told me His college roommate also a 2015 Madison graduate killed himself in March Morgan was in an apartment next door just before dawn when he got the news Morgans brother who had been visiting showed up bloodied and crying hysterically Hes gone he said His roommate had shot himself on the living room couchNo one knows why but he did Morgan saidThose young adults and teenagers even middle schoolers from Madison who killed themselves in the past few years have left behind unanswerable questions At least three students in the class of 2015 and one from 2014 have committed suicideOne a former soccer star hanged herself from the basketball hoop in her familys driveway Another hanged himself in his garage Another David Lee Wheeler shot himself as he hanged himself from a 100yearold maple tree in his yardHis mother Dee Wheeler was the waitress at Horsts bakery who had asked me for help She and I met for lunch after her shift had endedThis really came out of nowhere Wheeler said of her sons suicide He was fine when I last saw him that night Before going to bed I said to him Theres crab salad in the refrigerator It was his favoriteMadison is a swingshift town where its not uncommon for parents to work two or more jobs So if a child is looking for an available adult role model a football coach  a Patric Morrison  can be a last best hopeLast season Morrison paid special attention to Jace Humes who started the season as quarterback Humess parents had just disappeared into rehab and prison Another player was dealing with the suicide of his older brother  Curry Morgans roommate So many things for Morrison to worry about outside the Xs and Os of the game but his players appreciated his effortOn senior night of a 19 season the players gave speeches describing how the team had been their oasisFor two years in a row my sister tried killing herself offensive lineman Chance Webster told teammates and coaches as he sobbed Because of football I was able to get through life when I was really down I just want to thank you guysIn the same week last fall in which Madison won a national award for being a stellar community the Cubs played a firstround playoff game against Silver Creek High School in Sellersburg Ind a suburb of LouisvilleAfter so many injuries including to Humes the seasons starter his backup and the backups backup the Cubs were left with a freshman quarterback Their biggest weakness though was defense The Cubs gave up more than 450 yards 373 on the groundThey lost to Silver Creek 427Under the fields dimming lights and with chirping crickets in the distance Morrison gave his seasonending speechHe remained stoic Deep down he had thought the Cubs might win because theyd played a tougher schedule than Silver Creek had If the Cubs had won maybe his brother would have gotten out of prison in time to see the teams second playoff gameThe defeat ended that possibilityZach Morrison left prison five days laterI am proud of every single one of you Patric Morrison told his players He addressed the seniors No matter where you go or what you do I will always be a contact for youMany of the seniors had been teammates since fourth grade Now they were crying The face of Webster the lineman was red his body trembling He struggled to gain enough composure to talkIm not crying because we lost because it really doesnt matter that we lost he saidIm crying because its overEmail julietnytimescomAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,sports

AdvertisementSupported byThe authorities in Austria raided the headquarters of biathlons global governing body following a tip from the World AntiDoping Agency that its leaders may have been involved with the vast Russian doping scandal that continues to roil international sportsThe Salzburgbased International Biathlon Union which has long had close links to Russian sports confirmed the investigation in a news release on Wednesday in which it also announced that its longtime secretary general Nicole Resch had requested a leave of absence The IBU said the investigation focused on Resch  who had publicly questioned sports regulators conclusions about Russias systematic cheating  and the groups president Anders Besseberg a former biathlete and crosscountry skier who is also a board member of the antidoping agencyThe raid escalates the Russian doping scandal at a time when sports officials have tried to put it in the rearview mirror Investigators have established that huge amounts of corruption within Russias system tainted track and field The raid in Austria signals that the investigation has extended to other sports governing bodies and could raise additional questions about possible bribery in other federationsBiathlon had been at the center of a number of allegations related to Russian doping years before the 2016 revelations of a statesponsored scheme that corrupted dozens of sporting events including to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi RussiaThe raid on the biathlon organization came after the antidoping agency gave details gleaned by its own investigation team to law enforcement officials in Norway  where a raid also took place  and Austria as well as the global police organization Interpol The government investigation began in 2017 and resulted in surveillance of potential targets late last year according to three people familiar with the caseWADA confirms that the issue is linked to doping but as the police investigation is ongoing the agency can make no further comment at this stage the organization said in a statementThe Norwegian broadcaster NRK citing a news release from the countrys financial crimes investigator reported that the police there were providing assistance to Austrian authorities who suspected Norwegians of economic crimeBesseberg 72 is from Norway and is one of the longestserving sports federation presidents He did not respond to requests for commentLate last year after the International Olympic Committee had banned the Russian Federation from the 2018 Winter Olympics Besseberg announced that Russias biathlon organization had been relegated to provisional membership  a largely symbolic suspension that did not limit Russias ability to host events That prompted an outcry from some sports officials and boycotts of competitions in Russia by American and Canadian biathletesThis weeks raid came as another prominent Norwegian sports figure  Linda Helleland the nations minister of children and equality who also serves as the vice president of the antidoping agency  proposed an overhaul of global sports antidoping system in the wake of the Russian doping scandalWhy has it been so difficult to secure universal acceptance of the facts Helleland wrote in a proposal circulated privately among WADA executives and obtained by The New York Times Her analysis of the scandal is expected to be discussed at the organizations foundation board meeting next month How can we avoid the confusion that arose when Russian athletes were treated differently from sport to sport and sometimes within one sportIn an interview in Austria in December Besseberg called the rash of Russian doping violations damaging and said that in reviewing suspicious cases he had considered each athletes circumstances individuallyWe are handling cases and taking our decisions he said WADA can appeal if they dont agree with our decisionsThe full scope of the Russian doping program was revealed by Grigory Rodchenkov a former director of the countrys antidoping laboratory Rodchenkov who is in hiding in the United States provided details of abuses in biathlon according to his lawyer Jim WaldenDr Rodchenkov has been cooperating with the investigation of the International Biathlon Union and with other investigations Walden said in a statement We are hopeful that all doping fraud and corruption in international sports is fully exposed and we will continue to work diligently to make that a realityIn an interview published earlier Wednesday Rodchenkov told NRK the Norwegian broadcaster that biathlon officials had ignored suspicious blood passport results registered by Russian biathletes Instead of investigating the anomalies officials simply sent the information to Russias antidoping agency which was itself at the center of the cheating schemeRussia received sensitive information from IBU with a message to take care of it Rodchenkov said according to NRK Rodchenkovs claims of a sophisticated scheme to replace drugtainted samples with clean ones was validated by three separate independent investigationsDoping by Russian athletes infected biathlon for years and even after the wider doping program was unmasked the IBU faced repeated criticism from many of its own members for what they perceived to be weak antidoping policies and a soft stance toward Russia That prompted teams from the United States Ukraine and the Czech Republic to withdraw from last months seasonending event in the Russian resort TyumenIn 2011 Jacques Rogge then the IOC president was so concerned about Russias biathlon federation that he urged the countrys president at the time Dmitri A Medvedev to take stronger action Rodchenkov said in a sworn statement that the billionaire owner of the Nets Mikhail D Prokhorov played a role in obscuring the scheme when he led the Russian Biathlon Union Prokhorov who denies the claim is helping to finance a New York defamation suit against Rodchenkov by three banned biathletesIn investigating corruption related to Russian sports doping the Austrian and Norwegian authorities have joined French and American officials who have conducted their own inquiries dating back several years While French authorities initially centered their attention on track and field officials they later broadened their scrutiny

to break a 20year drought she tucked her gold medal under the covers right next to herWe did it she said to herself again and again as her eyes finally closed on a night to remember for both the United States team and womens sports in AmericaYes the Americans did it  they beat their rivals in the hardest of hardfought finals There may be little competition in womens hockey outside the two final teams But the Americans story line is even richer than this thrilling victory that was the pinnacle of the Pyeongchang Olympics for the United States which is in danger of finishing these Games with its lowest medal count since 1998 back when the Games didnt include many of the extreme sports in which Americans excelTheir victory meant so much more than just a puck flying into the net to end a tense shootoutWe all knew that this game was much bigger than just a game Duggan said It was on all of our minds going inHeres why Last March the players threatened to boycott the world championships because negotiations with USA Hockey over equal pay and support hadnt gone anywhere in more than a year The women argued that they werent getting paid a living wage and that girls youth hockey was being overlooked by the federation while money poured into the boys side of the game The players also wanted policies for maternity leave and child careThere was a standoff The federation began hunting for replacement players for worlds The national team players began calling those potential replacements asking them to take their side for the good of the games future  for all the women and little girls who hoped to be treated equally in the futureA lot was at stake The world championships were being held in Michigan An American boycott would have been a huge embarrassment The players risked ruining their shot at these Olympics and derailing their careers But their effort resonated outside the sport Billie Jean King lent her support and so did a group of United States senators No matter the consequences the hockey players wouldnt  and didnt  back downUSA Hockey was forced to give up and it was a pivotal moment in the history of womens sportsWe bonded so much over it and it brought us together Duggan said on Friday I dont think wed be here right now if we hadnt stuck togetherThree days before the world championships last year the players and the federation signed a new deal that provided athletes a salary of about 70000 a year That office victory has given the players so many options nowThey dont have to quit the sport because they cant support themselves Before their new contract with USA Hockey players were paid 6000 in an Olympic year  and nothing in between Olympic years Now the women dont have to worry about their finances when making the decision of sticking with the game or notThe worlds best athletes schussed down the slopes zoomed down the track and skated across the ice in South Korea Heres what you want to know about this years eventsJocelyne LamoureuxDavidson who scored the winning goal in the shootout said she could now consider staying with the game because she still loved it and was still good at itTo have that choice I think means the world to us she saidTo have a gold medal around their necks isnt so bad eitherWhen LamoureuxDavidson scored in the sixth round of a tiebreaking shootout her shot resonated throughout the sportDuring Thursday nights celebration Duggan said she and her teammates watched video of the winning goal a thousand times because as far as they were concerned it was the most beautiful goal theyd ever seen in the history of hockey With a couple of deft fakes and a whir of her stick LamoureuxDavidson sent the puck skittering past Canadas goalie giving the United States the 32 victory and their first Olympic gold medal since 1998I feel like the gold medal adds more credibility to what were trying to do with womens sports in our country forward Hilary Knight said Im not saying our voice or our skills are any less if we didnt win I just think more people start paying attention and were 100 percent trying to inspire the next generationThe team spent Friday being interviewed by reporters from morning until evening and they could barely stop to breatheDuggan told me that this whole year has been for womens hockey in America and so much moreThis is a moment for women in other sports and women in business and in every single walk of life she said We need to show our power and what women can do so we can work more toward equalityThinking about that responsibility can be overwhelming Knight said She spent all night Thursday and all Friday thinking about the bigger picture of this Olympic victoryShe thought about it so much and celebrated it so much as she sipped Champagne and chatted with friends and family members that she never even fell asleep Thursday nightFriday she kept her gold medal in the pocket of her Team USA jacket She said she didnt wear the medal because its ribbon pulls on her neck too much Its heavyYou want to hold it she asked me opening up my hand and placing the gold medal in my palmAnd it was surprisingly heavy About a pound and a quarterIts so cool right she said explaining how shed place it safe and sound next to her pillow Friday night Maybe she will even get some sleepEmail

Los Angeles and they couldnt afford a babysitter for Mirai their only child So while they worked Nagasu would nap on a yoga mat in a storage room until closing time But instead of snoozing she often would read relying on the light that peeked from beneath the doorHarry Potter was her favorite character He was the kid who faced great obstacles and sometimes stumbled but he succeeded in the endNagasu liked the way that sounded Now she can relateAt 24  older than all but one of her competitors here  Nagasu is competing in her second Olympic womens singles competition this week eight roller coaster years after her first one She is not here for sentimentality though She is here to win a medalAbout twothirds of the women in the field are teenagers which should make you realize that Nagasu is something special At an age when most other female skaters have long been spit out of the sport because of burnout injury or lack of success she not only has hung in there but has risen to another level with her jumpsFigure skaters are usually young and then just fade away she told me But Im not a fadeaway kind of personAt the 2010 Vancouver Games Nagasu was only 16 when she finished a surprising fourth She thought she deserved a topthree finish So she looked to the 2014 Sochi Games as another chance for the podiumBut Nagasu  famously and heartbreakingly for her  was passed up for the United States team that year even though she finished third at the United States nationals Three Americans not named Mirai Nagasu went to Sochi instead chosen by a committee considered the skaters body of work that season not merely their performance at nationalsNagasu cried almost nonstop in the weeks and months after being passed over She blamed herself for being lazy She felt as if her chance at an Olympic medal had vanished She considered hanging up her skates wondering if her very public journey as a skater who was brilliant but erratic was worth it At 14 she was the secondyoungest skater ever to win a United States championship and then things grew complicated when her body started changingWhat pulled her back into skating was an April 2014 trip to Colorado Springs to visit a friend Agnes Zawadzki Zawadzki was training with Tom Zakrajsek a coach who once worked with one of Nagasus biggest competitors the 2010 Olympian Rachael FlattNagasu had always admired Flatts consistency because it had always been Nagasus weakness She took a few sessions with Zakrajsek and decided that the 2018 Olympics could be within her reach She asked Zakrajsek to coach her and packed up her Honda Civic for her new life in ColoradoThe daughter of Japanese immigrants Nagasu had wanted to move out of her parents house in Arcadia Calif when she was a rebellious 17yearold But her mother Ikuko and her father Kiyoto would not allow it This time they were supportiveSo Mirai Nagasu packed up her childhood bedroom leaving the pink Miss Smiley comforter and most everything else behindYour room will always be here just like it is in case you need an escape Ikuko Nagasu told Mirai before she drove away I promise Im not going to make it a sewing roomIn Colorado Springs Nagasu lived with a host family and learned how to cook for herself After many failed attempts she mastered meatloaf and baked desserts for her friends at the rink She adopted her first of three dogs took college classes and began dating Darian Weiss an actor and their relationship grew serious She eventually moved into her own houseTo help pay the bills she got a job that was far different from when she worked at her familys restaurant where as a little girl she was paid in quarters for washing dishes She became an ice girl for the Colorado Avalanche during the 201516 hockey season and her task was to clean the ice with a shovel while wearing a tiny skirt and crop topLiving a real life an adults life outside of the rink has helped her focus inside the rink even more In her sport thats usually a foreign conceptNagasu was rejuvenated by Zakrajseks technical help but also by his pep talks On Saturdays he brings his skaters in for sports concepts classes where he plays clips from inspirational movies or gives motivational lessonsAs for Nagasus experience with missing the 2014 Games Zakrajsek said they had spent about five minutes on it in the past four years There was too much ahead of them they decided to look back and wallowAhead of them was something bigger a triple axel Its a jump that only two female skaters  Mao Asada and Midori Ito of Japan  had landed at the OlympicsAt Nagasus age though learning a new jump was virtually unheardof The conventional wisdom in skating is that young girls learn to jump and that women only refine what they learned as young girls But the jump garners a tremendous number of points because of its difficulty So she trained and trained and last summer she finally landed itShell do triple axels after triple axels until Tom has to drag her off the ice said Vincent Zhou who finished sixth last week in the Olympic mens singles event Shes incredible She will skate 17635 long programs and then do a short program every single day Shes the hardest worker I knowIn last weeks team event Nagasu nailed her long program including landing the triple axel It helped the United States team win the bronzeI knew in my heart this day would come she saidThis week in the singles she said she believes she can land it again Maybe then shell let herself fade away  a woman at the top of a girls sport and one with at least one

booth his happy face and giddy voice connected to so many memorable moments When a skater hit a big jump or won a gold medal your TV would just about shake because of his excitementHamilton 59 knew this change was coming Even in Russia four years ago he knewJohnny and Tara were just this phenomenon and no one was going to stop them Hamilton said of Lipinski and Weirs breakout performance on the NBC Sports Network during the 2014 Sochi Games The worst thing I can do is have an ego in all this because its not about me They were such a breath of fresh airYet it seemed reasonable to make this about Hamilton at least a little I was curious to see how a skater who didnt lose for four straight years in the 1980s and who won the 1984 Olympic gold medal would handle forfeiting such a valuable public roleIt couldnt be possible for him to have taken this demotion lightly considering he wrote a book called Finish First Winning Changes Everything which was published this monthHamilton laughed off my assumptionsIn the past 21 years he has faced Stage 4 testicular cancer followed by three brain tumors  one every six years since 2004 Hes living with a brain tumor right nowSo in the fall of 2014 when Hamilton reached out to Jim Bell NBCs president of Olympics production and programming to find out if he would be working on Skate America that October Bell called him back to break the news NBC valued him and adored him Hamilton recalled Bell saying and the network appreciated all his years at the top But it was time for a changeThere was a sadness for about 10 minutes Hamilton said last week at the Olympic figure skating arena I lamented it being over I thought Oh man that was such a beautiful part of my life and now its over But change happens to everyone  even meHamilton gets it Something like this happens to even the best of us  eventually  right Corporate America decided that his shelf life had expired There was nothing he could do about itBesides after he had spent so many years just trying to stay healthy  and alive  how could being replaced by the next big thing really matter In his heart Hamilton knew it did not He would bounce back almost out of habitI calculated once how many times I fell during my skating career  41600 times he said But heres the funny thing I got up 41600 times Thats the muscle you have to build in your psyche  the one that reminds you to just get upLooking ahead Hamilton knew there was so much more to worry about and in the end so much he decided not to worry aboutAfter overcoming testicular cancer in 1997 he learned that he had a pituitary tumor in 2004 one that had wrapped itself around his optic nerve The tumor was benign but it threatened to grow in ways that dangerously crowded his brainHamilton said he had prayed about 12 times a day for it to go away Doctors treated him with radiation and the tumor did go awayIn 2010 it reappeared Surgery caused an aneurysm that temporarily blinded him in one eyeHamilton said he would never forget what his wife Tracie said to him during a pep talk Joy is not the lack of suffering or fear its how you choose to handle the suffering and fear It finally hit him that it was trueSo when the tumor returned for an encore in 2016 Hamilton decided to react differently There was no why me anymoreI figured I needed to go through this with joy he said It was just a muscle I needed to build like the muscles I built skatingWhen one of his four children asked about the tumor Hamilton said Yep its back Its fine its fine its really fineFine  but also time to fight back in a new way There was no chance to undergo radiation treatment again It would only have fried his brain he said The tumor was still relatively small so Hamilton didnt need to rush into surgery He tried to tackle the problem differently He stopped eating sugar red meat and other things he considered bad for his body He started eating organic food and drinking only coffee or water with high pH He hit the treadmill and the weight roomWhen Hamilton went back to the doctor several months later he learned that his tumor hadnt grown During his next checkup he heard even better newsThe tumor had shrunk by about half Hamilton choked up when describing what happened nextHave you ever had one shrink without treatment before he said he asked the doctor And the doctor said Nope neverHamilton asked So how can you explain thisThe doctor said GodIt floored him He was in the process of losing three friends to colon cancer yet he somehow someway was given this miracle At his latest doctors visit in December the tumor was even smallerAt some point this tumor is going to start growing again and its going to start causing its mischief and Im going to have to deal with it he said But for now there must be a reason Ive gotten this pass Theres something that I need to be doing I just have to figure out what that isDuring the figure skating events last week Hamilton stood on a riser just above Lipinski Weir and Terry Gannon the third member of the main broadcasting team Hamilton couldnt miss them when the lights came on and they were on center stage just as he used to be He looked on often peeking at them over his reading glasses But he said the change hadnt been awkward and Lipinski echoed thatWhen I first started as a commentator I listened to all of Scotts tapes and learned so much because he was so incredible said Lipinski who won the Olympic gold medal in 1998 He called my Olympics and was like a big brother to me when we toured together Hes been a mentor and of course he was at my wedding last summer I think this whole thing is just a natural progression for usShe said he was still involved in the broadcast in a big way because he brings something unique  and thats Scott Hamilton being Scott HamiltonHe has such enthusiasm for the sport she saidHes a legend in skating arenas So much so that Maxim Trankov half of the Russian pairs team that won gold in 2014 stopped Hamilton on Wednesday and asked him to pose for a selfieOh wow thank you so much Trankov said I watched you skate all the time when I was a kid Youre amazingHamilton returned the compliment and told Trankov they should grab coffee sometime He was gracious as alwaysThere was a little apprehension coming to these Olympics because nobody likes change he told me But Ive decided to make this fun because Im doing things joyfully And turns out it is funAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,sports

allBack then Pechstein was just a kid a 19yearold competing as a speedskater for a unified Germany after growing up on the eastern side of the Berlin Wall At those 1992 Olympics Germanys first after reunification Pechstein shared a room with Christa LudingRothenburger the de facto team mom LudingRothenburger was 32 Pechstein thought that was ancientWhat does that make Pechstein now On Friday when she will contend for a medal in the 5000 meters shell be just six days shy of her 46th birthday She has won five Olympic gold medals two silvers and two bronzes Shes redefining what an Olympian should look likeThis is Pechsteins seventh Olympics A rare active athlete who can claim to have represented East Germany internationally shes at least 20 years older than more than half of her competitors in the 5000 Nine of the 17 athletes entered in the race werent born when she won her first Olympic medal a bronze at those 1992 Games in Albertville FranceIm Grandma said the woman whose longevity and rsum command respect and who might under normal circumstances be a sentimental favorite in these GamesBut the problem is that Grandma is a convicted doper though like nearly every convicted doper she denies ever using performanceenhancing drugs You want to like her But its complicated  just like everything seems to be in Olympic sports these daysIn 2009 Pechstein was barred from competing for two years because her blood showed an abnormal level of immature red blood cells Levels like that can be an indicator that she either used the endurancebooster EPO or a banned blood transfusion to gain an edge She was the first athlete to receive a suspension based not on a positive drug test but on irregularities in her blood profileOlympic federations require athletes like Pechstein to sign arbitration clauses that force them to take their cases to the Court of Arbitration for Sport an international sports court In doing this the athletes waive their rights to bring their case to courts in their home countries and Pechstein thought stripping her of that right was unjustifiedPechsteins competitive exile ended in 2011 but her battle to overturn the ban and upend the system of arbitration in international sports is still going on seven years later Pechstein who is a federal police officer in Germany just wont quitIn 2016 she lost her case in Germanys highest civil court which rejected her request for about 5 million in compensation from the International Skating UnionNow shes taking the case to yet another court This time its Germanys federal constitutional court and its worth our attention that the court has agreed to hear her complaintWhen asked why she has pushed on with her case for so long and exactly how she has stayed atop the sport for so many years Pechstein smiled and pointed to the man standing beside her her boyfriend and mental coach Matthias GrosseSometime in 2009 when Pechsteins doping case was in the news in Germany and some of the German fans who once loved her and voted for her as the countrys sportswoman of the year were now turning on her Grosse sent her an emailYou are at the bottom of your life the message read If you need help you can call me I might not be able to help much but Ill tryPechstein emailed him back Shortly after Grosse became part of her team helping her with her legal battle but also with her mental struggle He was her biggest cheerleader when she felt crushed that her reputation had crumpled The next year in 2010  the year she missed the Vancouver Olympics because of her ban  they became a coupleAfter the 3000 meters ended on Saturday Pechstein leaned over a partition to kiss Grosse They brought their foreheads together and whispered to each other before hugging On the lanyard that held his Olympic coaching credential was a round plastic button with their photo on it They are a cute pairFor me it was hard to come back after the ban especially at the same level I went out but I love skating and he helped me come back Pechstein said grabbing Grosses armA year ago in the 5000 meters Pechstein became the oldest woman in speedskating to win a World Cup race and the oldest woman in the sport to make it to the podium at a world championship Athletes older than her have won Olympic medals but it will still be a remarkable achievement if she can add to her collection hereShes a very special athlete not normal said her teammate Roxanne Dufter 25 I cannot imagine that its possible to stay motivated for so many OlympicsDufter said that Pechstein is friendly with younger teammates and often gives them skating tips When theyre on the ice together no one notices an age difference Dufter saidIts like were the same Dufter said When we see the style of clothing off the ice maybe you can see theres 20 years between usPechstein says she cant explain why she still goes fast I would say speedskating is in her blood but that probably wouldnt be the most appropriate way to phrase itAnd despite what cynics might think Pechstein says her endurance is simple The training regimen she learned in East Germany was strict and serious and it gave her a strong foundation Now that shes older she requires more rest but she added theres no special secret to her success Especially not a secret dietIll eat everything chocolate ice cream she said And why not Im just humanPechstein said her goal is to be happy which she seemed to be as she stood arminarm with Grosse after her race But her doping case still looms over all that she has done and hopes to achieve and finally winning it she said is motivation enough for her to keep goingMaybe Ill even try for another Olympics she said An eighth one Why notEmail julietnytimescomAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,sports

down from her role as the acting chief executive of the United States Olympic Committee It showed that there was some accountability for an embarrassing failure and that someone needed to  and did  take the fall for a very public stumbleIn comparison what do we have in light of the sexual abuse of 250plus gymnasts at the hands of Dr Lawrence G Nassar a former member of the USOCs national medical network advisory boardThe opposite of accountabilityIts the USOC board members praising Scott Blackmun the Olympic committees chief executive at a news conference in Pyeongchang on Friday for serving the organization with distinction and for doing a phenomenal job even though the Nassar scandal unfolded under his watchIts Larry Probst chairman of the committees board apologizing to Nassars victims but also saying hey the USOC hasnt come out of this scandal unscathed because there has been a tremendous amount of criticismProbst said that Blackmun would be keeping his job  for which he was paid 1 million in 2016  until the USOC has reason for him to leave The organization has ordered an independent investigation of its actions in the Nassar matterBlackmun is not in Pyeongchang because he is recovering from surgery to treat prostate cancerAnd its not enough that Senators Jeanne Shaheen Democrat of New Hampshire and Joni Ernst Republican of Iowa called last week for Blackmuns removal Or that more and more calls for Blackmuns head are coming in by the day Those demands make complete sense when the USOCs weak oversight of Olympic sports national governing bodies very likely helped a predator like Nassar thriveOn Thursday Senator Dianne Feinstein a California Democrat who sponsored a bill that made it mandatory for Olympic governing bodies to report sexual abuse to the police also called for Blackmuns resignationIf Mr Blackmun did nothing for a year after learning about the allegations of widespread sexual abuse then he should step down Ms Feinstein said through a spokeswoman in response to emailed questions There can be zero tolerance for turning a blind eye to sexual abuse of minorsBoth senators from Colorado Senator Michael Bennet a Democrat and Senator Cory Gardner a Republican  said through their representatives that anyone who knew about the Nassar accusations and did nothing must step down The USOC is based in ColoradoProbst said on Friday that Blackmun had acted just as he was supposed to after learning of the accusations against NassarBut the call for Blackmuns ouster shouldnt be just about the USOCs role in the Nassar matter Because its certainly not the only sexual abuse scandal that has unfolded under Blackmuns watchTo his credit Blackmun spearheaded the efforts to create the Denverbased US Center for SafeSport a national nonprofit organization providing education and resources including a hotline to promote respect and prevent abuse in sport It took seven yearsOther sports like swimming taekwondo and judo have had major abuse problems and Blackmun was introduced to some of them soon after he took over as chief executive in 2010 Right away he should have recognized that the USOC needed to oversee the federations with a sharper eye and make it a priority to address abuse He should have seen that it was the USOCs duty to keep all athletes safeIn 2010 three months after Blackmun was hired USA Swimming came under fire for mishandling dozens of sexual abuse cases That year the swimming organization set up a program to investigate sexual abuse accusations within its own sport But letting a federation investigate itself is never a good idea and the abuse continuedAt the Rio Olympics Blackmun addressed revelations in The Indianapolis Star that USA Gymnastics had kept files of more than 50 complaints of sexual abuse of athletes but failed to report them to law enforcementHe called the USOCs policy regarding sexual abuse state of the art even though the US Center for SafeSport  whose charge was to investigate sexual abuse and other misconduct cases  hadnt yet openedWe became more focused on this issue in 2010 Blackmun saidThe SafeSport center started fielding calls in 2017 Thats seven years of abuse cases in Olympic sports and seven years of the USOC letting national federations investigate their own abuse casesThat slow pace is a slap in the face to athletes It showed that Blackmuns priority wasnt to protect athletes It took 200plus abuse cases of girls and women in gymnastics for him to finally open his eyesBlackmun and the USOC couldnt have missed the glaring fact that national federations shouldnt be left to investigate themselves no matter the issue The federations goal is to market and promote their sports so they cant be trusted Its why the United States AntiDoping Agency was formed to handle drug testing and drug cases When the federations were in charge of policing themselves athletes often seemed to get away with cheatingYet Blackmun is more than hanging on The USOC is applauding him What message does that send to the hundreds of athletes who have been abused since he took over as chief executiveA terrible oneSo when considering whether Blackmun should stay or go remember what he said in Rio regarding that initial report of abuse in gymnasticsWe have to think first and foremost of the athleteEmail julietnytimescomAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,sports

Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Several other residents were college presidents including one who was appointed by President Nixon to a White House task force on womens rights and responsibilitiesMany of the retired nuns living here at the orders headquarters planned to drop everything to watch Loyola play against seventhseeded Nevada on Thursday night in Atlanta The gathering was certain not to be your typical March Madness viewing partyAnd then again When we watch Loyola play yes sometimes people do yell at the television  some more than others Sister Bernadette McManigal 83 and a former superintendent of schools for the diocese in Arlington Va said on WednesdayPlans for game time called for popcorn to be served in the community room of the headquarters main building known as the Motherhouse On Wednesday the rooms flatscreen TV sat off to the side a diversion of no more consequence than several puzzles laid out on tables including one called The Lords Blessing with most of its 500 pieces still astrayThe Sister Jean bobblehead doll part of a 2011 supply that hinted at inevitable national stardom is displayed at the headquarters among other artifacts from the orders long history  a cherrypitter from the 1850s butter molds and a shoemaking kit also from the 1800s when the order set up camp hereAs recently as the 1970s the BVMs were about 2300 strong according to the orders spokeswoman Now there are only about 330 of the nuns including Sister Jean on the Loyola campus and the roughly 180 retirees living here Nearly all of the orders nuns have trained at the Dubuque headquarters before going off to serve somewhere whether in the United States or abroad That means everybody in the order pretty much knows everybody elseAnd everybody knows  and loves  Sister JeanScouting reports from her fellow BVMs on Wednesday included comments like a worker morning until night and a person who is influential especially with young people Everyone marveled at Sister Jeans ability to deftly answer questions on television as if she was born to be on cameraHow many young people would usually be interacting with a 98yearold like this Sister Pat Donahoe 86 said I think shes enjoying it and I think lots of people think its wonderful to hear what she has to say This is a winwin situationStill some of the retirees wonder whether fame obscures what Sister Jean has done in a life of service to the core values of her order freedom education charity and justice One of her sisters for example started a clinic for leprosy patients in Ecuador and another ran an orphanage in OmahaTheres a lot of irony in this said Sister Carolyn Farrell a former associate vice president of LoyolaChicago who is also a former mayor of Dubuque We often like to talk about peace and justice and living in the margins and helping other people And of course Jean Dolores did all of that earlier in her career But now the camera isnt on peace and justice its on Jean DoloresIts like hmm you have a basketball star chaplain she said and at the same time were knocking ourselves out to help the poorSister Jeans peers point out that she was a teacher for many years in California before moving to Chicago in 1961 to teach and then serve as administrator at Mundelein College an allwomens school founded and run by the BVM order The college was known for its activism and its work to advance womens rightsIn 1991 Mundelein suffering from dwindling enrollment and funding was folded into LoyolaIt was a very sensitive time said Sister Carolyn 83 who was Mundeleins president during that transition and then started the Gannon Center for Women and Leadership at Loyola The feeling always was Wed rather be dead than coedTheres no evidence that the history has cut into the sisters support for Loyola basketball By all accounts though the Chicago Cubs march to a World Series championship two years ago drew a much larger audience in the community roomOther sisters recall annual trips years ago to see the Iowa girls high school basketball championship in Des MoinesSister Margaret McCulloch 78 said she was a pretty good basketball player way back when She also coached girls basketball and volleyball when she taught in elementary school and even took one of her girls basketball teams to the Catholic Youth Organization finals when she worked on Long IslandShe said it had always bugged her to see men coaching women and girlsI wouldnt feel too bad if I saw a woman coaching a mans team Sister Margaret said but I havent seen that yet So And she will never forget watching Immaculata University play in the 1970s when the Mighty Macs were the first powerhouse womens basketball program in the United States The university in Malvern Pa was founded by nunsIt was such a great experience Sister Margaret said All of the sisters were there and they had drums and a variety of thingsNow if Immaculata were in the tournament maybe just maybe Sister Margaret would pick the Macs to win it all Instead her Final Four teams are Loyola Villanova Gonzaga and  one nonCatholic team  Clemson After that so much for her loyalty to Sister Jean She chose Villanova to win the championshipBut thats not half as bad as Sister BernadetteI had Loyola losing in the first round Sister Bernadette said explaining that she had picked the favorites Oh yes Im

faceTheres Shaq he criedIndeed there was Shaquille ONeal even larger than life frozen middunk Hanlon rapped on the coppertoned torso It was hollow as a PVC pipeThis was just a polymer cast of the real statue of ONeal  that 900pound monument of bronze and granite stands proudly outside the Pete Maravich Assembly Center in Baton Rouge La where ONeal played his college games for LSU It didnt bother Hanlon that the cast was covered in snow resting ignominiously outside an old chicken coop like a fallen oak Hed actually had forgotten it was out here Hed been busyHanlons phone keeps ringing because sculpture seems to be enjoying a renaissance particularly among universities and teams flush with television riches and eager to celebrate their glory daysBut statues are coming down too cities like Charlottesville Va New Orleans and Memphis among others have removed Confederate monuments and a petition to remove a prominent Christopher Columbus statue in New York also gained tractionIn the uproar Hanlon says he has heard a kind of wakeup call Times change But bronze can last foreverI realized how important and powerful what I was doing was he said There may be some days I do take it for grantedRaised in Holmdel NJ Hanlon 56 speaks often about the spiritual connection between his art and its inspiration Part of that is the result of his own relationship with clay it rescued him he said from a serious alcohol addiction that derailed much of his early adulthood  until he arrived at Boston University in 1988 Finally sober at age 27 he invested in a future with his handsHe used waterbased clay rather than oilbased which is firmer and less pliable He found that he could manipulate the clay to convey an aspect of the sculpture that does not quite belong in church movementHis statues since then are rarely the static forms that make other pieces seem well statuesqueIts his love of sports that you see in the statues  the motion and the energy said Chris Riccardo a ceramic artist and classmate at BU But its Brian You sit down with him and he will sell you on how important art is to him and to this world Hes so positive with everythingHanlons studio is the 3000square foot coop which he began renting from a local farmer in 1992 located in an overgrown field off a hidden dirt road It had no air conditioning no bathroom and no windows so Hanlon poked two skylights through the roof He shares the space with a mattress firm which uses it for storageThis is my stuff here he said pointing to the cast husks of gigantic statues of a lion a dog and the former football star Ernie Davis all scattered behind the coop They have spilled outside near an abandoned station wagon because there is no space left insideHanlon unlocked the coop and in dusty lighting and shivering cold revealed the resin casts of nearly a hundred other statues many of them familiar Next to the boxer Larry Holmes extending a ferocious left fist was the former Temple basketball coach John Chaney pointing a bony finger Behind them was the figure of Steve Gleason a former NFL player who has ALS blocking a puntConstructing a Shaqsize sculpture out of bronze is tough work Hanlon starts with a fullscale armature  a skeleton of sorts made with rebar steel foam wood chicken wire and other materials You name it Hanlon said Whatever can hold that clayMore than 1500 pounds of clay were heaped onto that underlying armature rendered and finessed so that the tiniest details of ONeal muscle definition jersey wrinkles hair strands could shine through the finished patinaIn 2015 Hanlon unveiled a 25ton monument to Dr James Naismith based on a picture of Naismith showing a basketball to some children Hanlon recreated the image with a twist  he sculpted the likeness of a young Earl Lloyd the NBAs first black player onto one childs face to evoke a sense of the games evolutionYet Hanlon also has learned to keep his ears open to different sources of inspirationStephen A Smith is a great one Hanlon said referring to the bombastic ESPN commentator He was screaming about some player the other day and I thought You know somebody should make a statue of that guyHe pitches many of the ideas directly to prospective clients Though they may resist the idea of spending 125000 to 180000 for a statue of their own a few come to realize that there are few better ways to capture the spirit of an iconYou feel the person the Syracuse athletic director John Wildhack said You get a sense for the person and the strength the spirit the resolve the commitment that they all had in their own wayAfter sculpting the clay around the armature Hanlon paints it with several layers of rubber followed by coats of plaster and fiberglass This forms the mold into which molten metal is eventually pouredForcing open that mold after it settles can be like ripping apart two ice cubes frozen as one For a statue of St Peter Hanlon once hooked a rig to his pickup attached a line to one side of the mold which was also attached to a wall and floored the gas pedal Other reveals involved ratchets and straps attached to the beams of the coopI cant believe that thing didnt fall in on me Hanlon said I did some crazy stuff in there for sureThe creation of the mold is critical If the integrity of your mold is no good Hanlon said you just blew months and months of workA bajillion mistakes could happen he added And somehow we pull it offToday he watches for those mistakes from half a world away most of the statues he designs now are forged and cast in a foundry he owns in Xiamen a port city in southeastern ChinaHanlon can coordinate every step of the monthslong process from the modeling to molding to bronzing to shipping via video conference Recently however he had to give up many of the handson aspects of his work because of health concerns  namely the effects of years of working with resin dust sequestered in the coopBut he says he no longer needs to feel the clay in his fingers to know when a statue could last in perpetuityIts the stories Hanlon said Im more interested in the back story than the sculpture itself If the back story is good the sculpture is going to be

AdvertisementSupported byLAS VEGAS  Mary Kelly and her husband Thomas Lindqvist are the type of fans that sports executives in Las Vegas dream aboutWhen the NHL released its schedule last summer Kelly and Lindqvist saw that their beloved Pittsburgh Penguins would visit Las Vegas to play the expansion Golden Knights on a Thursday in midDecemberEager to see their team play in the newest NHL city Kelly Lindqvist and a dozen friends planned a long weekend around the Penguins game They booked rooms on the Strip at the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino and spent the weekend seeing the sightsWe bought tickets as soon as they went on sale said Kelly who has had Penguins season tickets with her husband for a decade We go to about one road game a year to Chicago Buffalo New York DCBefore game time in Las Vegas she looked across a plaza outside TMobile Arena where many hundreds of Penguins fans were congregating and said We did not expect to see thisIts fair to say the owners of the Golden Knights the NHL and the city of Las Vegas did not expect that either By most measures the hockey teams inaugural season has been a smashing success  one the Raiders hope to duplicate when they move to the city from Oakland for the 2020 NFL seasonWith 41 wins and 87 points through Monday the Golden Knights have been extending the record for most wins by an NHL expansion team week after week In first place in the Western Conference they are the secondhighest scoring team in the league and look poised for a playoff runAccording to Fanatics the largest online seller of licensed sports goods the Golden Knights have ranked fourth in NHL merchandise sales this season  and first since the start of 2018The fast start by the Golden Knights has for now allayed fears that the NHLs decision to put another team in a desert city would lead to financial trouble See Coyotes Arizona Commissioner Gary Bettman has for years pushed for new teams in the Sun Belt with mixed success and aiming for Las Vegas in particular seemed like an overreachBut an influx of outoftown fans has complemented the Golden Knights fast start on the ice and at the box office This is good news for local hotels restaurants and casinos which host 43 million visitors a year and for the team as it gets its bearings in the marketOther NHL teams in areas that attract transplanted retirees  like the Arizona Coyotes and the Florida Panthers  also tend to have strong crowds supporting the opposition The Golden Knights though appear to have specifically designed their game nights like most things in their city as tourist attractionsWhile hockey is certainly the central focus of game nights the Knights have added a medieval motif sometimes comically The Zambonis that drive on the ice have jousts mounted on their sides to simulate a duel The arena includes a 24foot knights helmet and three castle structures including one for cheerleaders with pompoms Catapults are used to launch Tshirts into the crowdWe wanted to focus on Vegas as the entertainment capital of the world Bubolz saidBut the definition of success will be far different While the Knights play in a privately built arena Nevada promised to use 750 million in hotel taxes to help pay for a new domed stadium for the Raiders The bonanza of public money persuaded the leagues owners to let the team move and melted the NFLs longrunning objections to playing in Las Vegas  based on the presence of legal sports gamblingThe Raiders hope to double down on the Knights success at drawing outoftown visitors In most NFL markets roughly 5 percent of fans at a typical game are from out of town Yet according to the Raiders projections about half the fans at the 10 Raiders home games will come from outside Las Vegas including many from neighboring CaliforniaAs far back as a decade we all believed teams would travel very well to Las Vegas said Bill Hornbuckle the president of MGM Resorts International and a member of the Las Vegas Stadium Authority which has negotiated specifics of the stadium deal with the RaidersSporting events in Las Vegas he added make what is normally a threehour experience into a threeday experienceHornbuckle said that of the 48000 fans who had paid a deposit for personal seat licenses which will probably cost between 4000 and 6000 48 percent were from Southern Nevada But nearly 30 percent were from Southern California and the remainder from elsewhere in the countryBut while the Golden Knights moved into a preexisting arena the Raiders are responsible for construction of their stadium The team though will have to cover only about onethird of the estimated 18 billion price tag The rest will come from the hotel tax an NFL contribution of 200 million and an estimated 250 million from the fans seat license feesThe Raiders will operate the stadium and keep all revenue from every event there not only football games An existing monorail which was privately financed may be extended to reach the stadium and ease concerns about traffic and a lack of parkingJim Nagourney a former sports executive in New York who now lives in Las Vegas has repeatedly criticized the arrangement with the Raiders which could require taxpayers to cover any shortfall in the hotel tax revenue He said the number of available parking spaces was too small and he questioned whether half of the stadiums 65000 seats could be filled with outoftown fans Attendance for preseason games is notoriously spotty and if the Raiders play poorly their fans from outside Las Vegas may be less likely to travel long distances to see them he saidNagourney also said the assumption that fans would stay for nearly three days was based on visitors for conventions not sports events He does not believe it was necessary to bring the Golden Knights and the Raiders to Las Vegas to validate the citys statusIt was a prestige thing Nagourney said But find me a map that doesnt already have Las Vegas on

AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesThe United States Olympic Committee once stepped in to run the national governing body for team handball because it was plagued by a continued pattern of dysfunctionAt another time it stripped the power of the taekwondo federation because it had financial troubles and failed to effectively confront its problems In 2008 it threatened to disband USA Track  Field because the organization needed to shrink its board of directorsThose problems seem like jaywalking violations compared with the blatant failure of USA Gymnastics to protect its young gymnasts from a serial predator like Dr Lawrence G Nassar the longtime national team doctorSo why amid what is one of the worst sexualabuse scandals in sports history  one much bigger than the Penn State scandal that took down the longtime football coach Joe Paterno an athletic director and a university president  hasnt the Olympic committee fully held the gymnastics federation accountable for its incompetenceThe Olympic committee should decertify USA Gymnastics stripping it of its powers as a national governing body because the federation has failed at its most essential duty to protect young athletes Decertification is the most drastic thing the Olympic committee can do and the nuclear option is warrantedThe gymnastics federations failure to safeguard young girls was graver than financial instability or ineptitude on the playing field which were reasons the Olympic committee used to decertify other governing bodiesIts a rare move  the Olympic committee has decertified governing bodies only three times in recent years  but its necessary If not now when more than 150 girls and families have been hurt by a sport that turned its back on them then whenIf the Olympic committee needs encouragement to make the move it should just listen to the piercing words of the women who spoke at Dr Nassars sentencing hearing last week About 120 were expected to face Dr Nassar or provide statements regarding their abuseI was not protected Jordyn Wieber a 2012 Olympic gold medalist said on Friday as she said in public for the first time that Dr Nassar abused her My teammates were not protected My parents trusted USA Gymnastics and Larry Nassar to take care of me and we were betrayed by bothIn tears Ms Wieber described how Dr Nassar began grooming her with food and gifts when she was 8 and began molesting her when she was 14 How much more does the Olympic committee need to bulldoze USA Gymnastics so the organization can be rebuilt without the people who couldnt see or didnt want to see a monster right before themScott Blackmun chief executive of the Olympic committee wasnt available for comment for this column but heres a primer for himBecause of USA Gymnastics decadeslong practice of failing to report sexualabuse accusations in the sport to law enforcement Congress decided there needed to be a federal law to remedy it In the wake of the Nassar case Senator Dianne Feinstein Democrat of California introduced a bill that would make it mandatory for the national governing bodies of Olympic sports to report sexual assault to the police The bill passed the Senate in November and is expected to be passed in the House in the next few weeksA majority of the gymnastics federations officials and board members have remained in their posts throughout the Nassar scandal even though many of the women molested by Dr Nassar  including the Olympic gold medalist Aly Raisman  have repeatedly called for the officials to step down or be removedThree days after Simone Biles said she was abused by Dr Nassar and added that she dreaded going back to the national training center in Texas because she was abused there the gymnastics federation said it wouldnt return to that site That change came because of the power of Ms Biles and other women speaking upNow the Olympic committee should listen to the athletes tooMs Raisman and other gymnasts have called for Paul Parilla the federations chairman to step down but Mr Parilla  a lawyer and retired Marine Corps colonel  has only dug inIn a statement last March Mr Parilla  whose daughter Jennifer is a twotime Olympian in trampoline  said The entire leadership of USA Gymnastics shares the USOCs commitment to promoting a safe environment for athletes and we take its views very seriouslyYet in an investigative review paid for by the federation the former federal prosecutor Deborah J Daniels described the weaknesses of USA Gymnastics One of them was that the board didnt adequately address the sports sexualabuse problemHer report criticized the board because it didnt hold management accountable for protecting children failed to routinely question management about the issue and spent very little time discussing childabuse preventionMs Daniels also saw a problem with how long some members have been serving on the board because it could lead to insularity There is a provision in the federations bylaws for members to serve only two fouryear terms but Mr Parilla has been there for 19 yearsThe leaders of USA Gymnastics fought to keep the abuse secretMs Raisman has also said the federation prodded her to keep her abuse from the publicThe evidence is there that the gymnastics federation is in need of substantial change though I acknowledge that decertification presents some complicationsIf the federation is no longer recognized as the governing body of gymnastics top gymnasts can lose their funding Their status as athletes training at the Olympic training center in Colorado Springs might be revoked They might not be able to compete internationally because the international federation of gymnastics only recognizes athletes from a nation that has an official governing bodyStill all of these issues can be worked out in the interest of the athletes  the people who should matter mostThe Olympic committee could also put the gymnastics federation on probation which would be a way to warn it that it needs to changeThe Olympic committee needs to do something anything to signal to gymnasts that it cares about their safety  and not just about money and medalsWhich brings us back to Ms RaismanI have represented the USA at two Olympics and have done so successfully she said on Friday in the Ingham County Mich courthouse facing Dr Nassar And both USA Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee have been very quick to capitalize and celebrate my success But did they reach out when I came forwardNoNot a good look for this countrys Olympic officials After everything we heard last week why are they still propping up USA GymnasticsEmail julietnytimescomAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,sports
family is not made of money Unlike the people in the article receiving the homework therapy my parents cannot afford to send me to a private high school let alone a private collegeYou would also think that if the students are so busy with so much homework they wouldnt have the time for hourlong sessions devoted to talking about their homework instead of actually doing it Although I would love to learn how to manage my homework more properly nothing can be more efficient than what I do now plug and chugSo maybe after all I wont be needing that homework therapy my session can be taken by a teacher who needs to learn the limits of teenagers as well as the already rigorous schedules thrown at them before hours of ultimately useless homework is thrown at themI think that Jocelyn is totally right My family isnt made of money either and I have to take harder classes in order to hopefully get a scholarship I think that teachers should be the ones taking these sessions as well While I understand that honors and AP classes are supposed to be challenging 3 hours of homework from just one class is absolutely ridiculousIve always been skeptical of homework therapists application counselors and everything of the sort However this doubt comes from my own personality I prefer to work alone no matter the task school projects essay writing homework It feels too chaotic to have someone else adding their own ideas and thought processes to something thats already bothersomeBut my view of school advisors changed when I started meeting with a college counselor once a month Like any high school student I am very anxious about college and doing just the right thing for applications Nonetheless this college counselor helped me sort out my current goals and how to achieve them It took a load of stress off of me to know that someone accomplished in this field was guiding me through the processHomework therapists can seem excessive since the whole point of homework is for an individual to learn and display their own thoughts But when you think about the new amounts of pressure students have from school as well as extracurriculars these therapists can seem like a necessity As the article states tutoring is a 100 billion dollar industry and homework therapists are just a new addition From these facts its obvious that students do feel more comfortable with a pro in a specific subject or just have someone working with them So even though Im not completely sold on the idea of homework therapists I cant knock it till Ive tried itEveryday I dread going to school because of the homework projects and tests they assign It causes me to stay up late every night and stresses me out to the point that I have mental breakdowns I dont really have a way to deal with the stress I usually just power through it put on some music and sometimes I just have to stop working on my assignments and go to bed It works for me but I still get stressed very easilyA homework therapist is not necessary The parents in New York paying 200 to 600 just to have someone nudge their kids to finish an assignment is ludicrous As the article mentions the therapists also help with SAT prep and subject tutoring but I think its ridiculous that parents pay so much money for something their kids can go to their teacher and ask for help with My brother got a tutor for SAT prep the second time he took it but he ended up getting the same score so it was pretty pointless spending so much money on it when there are free websites that offer specialized practice tests with tips on taking the SATThe article also mentions how some homework therapists will tell their teenagers to create Spotify playlists to express their mood or hand out scented putty to calm them down This coddles these teenagers way too much Its important to be calm when in stressful situations but we need to learn to deal with our own problems and not someone treating us like were five years old and handing us a ball of PlayDoh or a coloring bookThere are so many times where I feel overwhelmed with homework or studying Sometimes I have to do both for one class not to mention the homework I have for my 3 other core classes and 2 academic electives I manage my time pretty well but I still feel like it is impossible to get everything done Especially towards the end of the year around testing time Reviewing homework new lessons studying tests theres so much going on and its very stressful To help sometimes I ask my friends for help if we can work on something together or if they can help me understand something better and complete it faster it helps a lot For a lot of students grades are the cause of stress Were taught that if if you dont do your homework then you dont understand the lesson you not only get a zero for homework but you also get one on the test if you dont pass the test then you wont pass the EOC if you dont pass the EOC then you dont pass the class equaling a low GPA which means you dont get into college At least thats what stresses me outI would definitely unofficially characterize myself as a germaphobe I hold doors open with my shoe avoid touching handrails and immediately wash my hands after coming home from any public place However I dont always think about more innocent ways bacteria are spread like through my phone The article states that a cell phone contains 10 times more bacteria than the average toilet seat Yikes This definitely makes sense though Usually a person has their phone 247 wherever they go placing it on random surfaces and then making contact with it As for diseases in bath toys we probably shouldnt be using any bathroom object for more than a couple months toys and razors alike I have never used a loofah after reading a terrifying article about how quickly mold can grow in themSo unless we come up with a disease repelling rubber duck we should probably put a time limit on the use of a particular squeaky bacteria breeding groundI tend to worry about keeping germs off of myself I have serious allergies and I usually get sick pretty easily to limit my infections I try to stay clean frequently But I stayed oblivious to the the sanitation of the objects around me When I eat or use the bathroom I make sure I wash my hands but little consideration was made when I use my phone that has been with me and my adventures for the last 56 years I can imagine that device is a planet of microorganisms suffering from overpopulation No wonder my allergies are so bad I just went from washing up a few minutes ago to cleaning my kitchen with a filthy cloth to typing on a microbe infested keyboard while maintaining he habit of scratching my hair and face It is obvious that just keeping myself sanitized isnt enough To stay healthy I should consider keeping the stuff I use and interact with in my house sanitizedGerms are literally everywhere Theres no way to avoid them So why are people so scared of them I grew up not worrying that much about germs Yes I washed my hands before I ate and I never put my hands in my mouth Okay I swear Im not disgusting my mom just realized that as kids there was going to be no way we could avoid all the germs that we are susceptible to throughout the day and wasnt a control freak about it I mean I wasnt more sick than the average kidAccording to the article there were over 350 different species of germs found 14 dirty kitchen sponges Even to someone who isnt a germaphobe that sounds gross The sponges we use to clean our dishes that we eat off of are completely covered in germs Worse than that there is on average 200 times more more fecal bacteria on a cutting board than a toilet seat Now thats disgustingAlthough I grew up being less weary about germs than the average person I still like to be healthy After reading this article I feel the need to wash my handsWhat doesnt kill you makes you stronger and that about sums up my thoughts on germs The thought of germs never passes my mind on a normal day and in the rare occasion that it does I just imagine my immune system becoming stronger My personal belief is that everyday germs can help strengthen my immune system Why would I waste my time worrying about some microscopic germs when I could put that time into changing the world Germs arent my enemies their my friendsI think its a great thing that nowadays we are much more aware of the negative affects of germs on our body knowing how to prevent germs and where to find them That our innocent little rubber duckies as stated in the article have the capacity to make us sick for days week even Growing up my mom was very aware of germs being diagnosed type 1 diabetic at a very young age made me prone to infections so she was always on the lookout clorox wipe in hand On the other hand was my dad who thought Hey if God made dirt then dirt dont hurt So as I got older I fell somewhere between the spectrum at a solid I know germs exist but Ill pass on the rubber gloves thanks range But knowing it can have a great impact on my health definitely keeps me alert the flu to me is scarier than the boogie monster and the tickle monster combinedThe thought of germs being basically everywhere has always lurked in the back of my mind but Ive never really had that universal fear of them in everyday life I follow the average American when it comes to clearing germs such as washing my hands well taking showers using hand sanitizer and other simple things However I dont believe it needs to be taken too far Reports showing hundreds or thousands of types of bacteria on daily frequently used items in my opinion are not truly helping anyone Stated in the article a microbiologist found that cellphones contain 10 times more bacteria than a toilet seat Now that definitely sounds intimidating but how is it necessarily helping I mean maybe people are more aware and use soap and hand sanitizer more often but other people might genuinely become scared It does seem like a scary thing especially when there are so many people around us getting sick but at the same time just because you have a phone doesnt mean you are going to get sick which is why I feel like some of these studies though true exaggerate the harm of germs and bacteria I am all for keeping clean and staying away from germs and I dont think there is anything wrong with being a germaphobe However at the same time I wish not all would try to influence some people to a point where fear comes from daily itemsTeachers build the foundations of our lives Without them life would just be blank Today teachers are very underappreciated they provide us with knowledge that will eventually help us build a life for ourselves of course they deserve better payMost teachers that I have met are passionate about helping their students learn and grow throughout their time at school Some teachers even go above and beyond to make sure that their students are receiving the best education that they canMy Latin teacher is making his own latin textbooks from scratch because he feels that the worndown and heavily outdated textbooks that we have now dont provide us with enough information to fully understand and benefit from the course He also spends most of his summer break planning for his classes for the following school year instead of going to the beach and relaxing One day during lunch he even made my friends and I tea Hes a teacher who cares and hes also a teacher who gets paid very poorly Teachers like him deserve more they deserve a higher payPublic schools also deserve more money as long as it goes to a good cause I think that public schools should receive more funds that go to new textbooks or more classrooms Not to new gyms that dont even fit the entire school No school needs two gyms I think that the funds need to be specifically aimed towards benefiting students educationI think teachers should be paid more I think they should be paid more because they do a lot for the kids and for their future Teachers have an average pay of 55000 a year and that is too low for what they do I think it should be raised to 62000 a year because they have to deal with annoying kids overwhelming papers to grade and give kids better paying jobs than what they have In conclusion i think they should be paid more because they deserve itIn a world where our government spent twenty seven million dollars teaching Moroccans how to make pottery five thousand dollars to produce a film about a pretty good fiddler and sixty six thousand dollars to determine what bugs do near lightbulbs I think it is terrible that we somehow cant find the adequate funds to pay some of the hardest working and most important people to our future I believe in small government however I also believe in public education and I think that one of the most essential duties of government is to provide a good education system for their citizens and that is simply not possible when teacher pay remains stagnant The teachers walking out in Oklahoma and Kentucky are courageous and I applaud their efforts and wish them to the best of luckOf course teachers should be paid more Eventually if their salary keeps decreasing whos going to even WANT to be a teacher anymore People will eventually start to quit and look for better jobs and nobody will want to become a teacher I believe that teachers should at LEAST make a more significant amount above standard minimum wageAs for public schooling  yes I do believe that we need more funding Its depressing to come to school everyday and see just how unfunded we are My school has actually started limiting copies so now most of my work is online  rarely ever on paper Im also in the band program at my school and our conversations often correlate back to how poorly funded we are Lots of our instruments and sound systems need replacing were in need of some new uniforms and repairs and we also need props for our marching shows and money to pay for expenses  but thats all a distant dream The most we ever get is money for the buses and maybe a new speaker and a new fluteSo in short  yes Teachers deserve a high raise in pay and public schools need to be funded betterTeachers are the backbone of this country Public education has taken so many young minds and turned them into amazing thinkers just like the lady in the video said they need top dollar Right now their funding is not cutting it I firmly believe that educators in this country are criminally underpaid and under rewarded These teachers are creating a newer generation of complex and understanding thinkers and weve decided to brutally underpay them for doing so This problem NEEDS to be fixed If we dont value teachers for what theyre actually worth theres no hope for our future generationsThe article mentions the need for political action in the upcoming election in November and I couldnt agree more The most effective route to take with this problem is strong political activism and change Both voting for senators that will actually make a change and continuing to protest will greatly help their cause It is also mentioned in the article that teachers in Oklahoma make 7000 dollars less than the average teacher in America This is just abysmal teachers should be making the 20 extra that they are trying so hard to achieve Our nation has to have a higher standard of pay For years we have taken public educators for granted but that stops nowTeachers need better pay and simply schools need more funding I have known a few teachers that have moved out of state because of how low the pay is but the problem is there really is not anywhere that teachers are getting paid enough It is interesting to me that these recent movement have gained so much strength with lawmakers and even their unions that are not taking action for rights Although West Virginia is what got teachers thinking they can make change it is the use and coordination of the internet specifically Facebook that has allowed these protests to be so effectiveIt also interests me how political it is becoming Supporting learning is something that is universal but not only are Republican states getting hard hit for their budget cuts but Democrats are trying to capitalize on it Just as teachers should try to be unbiased lawmakers so invest in education It still fills me with awe that something that so closely correlated with economic success lack of crime and health things that would lead to less spending in other area of governmentImagine a scenario where we didnt acclaim athletes for their countless trophies or models for their unrealistically proportioned bodies Where the price to watch a football game is pocket change and the store hands out magazines like food samples Who is the new power magnet of media and ruler of revenue The teacherNow at first this situation may be bizzare imagining your Math teacher as the new Lebron James or the Spelling Bee as big as the Super Bowl But ask yourself why adults who kickthrowhit a ball or reallife action figures rolling in more bread annually than a baker much less a teacher would see in their lifeHonestly Im surprised there needs to be a debate about raising a teachers salary from the abysmal 4050k range Just consider their line of work mentoring future generations who are currently irritating kids As in any job the quality of educators vary but employing a merit system would reward teachers who already engage students plus convince others to improve their methods However the current system has caused schools to sacrifice salarysupplies for years building a martyr mentality according to Mr Karvelis Unfortunately this mindset compels many people considering teaching to search instead for a more lucrative profession Meanwhile government expenses surge in other areas deemed more important to our future As mentioned in the article politicians must realize that this issue isnt partisan its just common senseAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,sports
AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesGANGNEUNG South Korea  The morning of the womens short program of figure skating at the Pyeongchang Olympics was just like any other competition morning for Bradie Tennell the United States national championShe crunched on some cornflakes She met with her mother so she could sew a hairpiece into her bun She listened to some classic rock with one of her favorite songs Queens Bohemian Rhapsody playing in her ears just before her performanceTennell likes her routine It helps her focus and focusing has helped her build a reputation as a woman who never ever stumblesSo when Tennell fell on her opening jump which was supposed to be a tripletriple combination it was a shock  and an unfortunate harbinger of another bad day for the United States figure skating teamHer teammate Mirai Nagasu also fell on her opening jump a triple axel Then the third American Karen Chen followed suit landing her initial triple Lutz with so much momentum that she had to put her hand down and forgo the second jump in that combinationIts kind of funny but kind of sad Chen said I wish we all nailed itTheir performance was the worst ever for the United States womens team in the Olympic short program which started in 1976 Nagasu finished ninth Chen 10th and Tennell 11th Nagasu is nearly 16 points  a canyon of a gap  behind the leader Alina Zagitova of RussiaAll is not lost A great free skate and a few breaks could produce a medal As the saying goes the ice is slippery But right now it looks as if the United States will finish off the podium AgainThe last time an American woman won an Olympic medal was in 2006 when Sasha Cohen took silver In the 10 Winter Games before that the United States always had at least one female medalist In five of them the Olympic champion was an American But that era of success is drifting further and further awayWhat can be done to stop this medal drought Samuel Auxier the president of US Figure Skating said that he heard that question all the time He has some answersAt the United States nationals last month Auxier told me that US Figure Skating used to overregulate its lowerlevel skaters The federation prohibited those young athletes from even trying triple jumps partly because of the possibility of injury He said that rule was instituted about 10 to 12 years ago and he contends that is one reason American skaters lately havent been as technically strong as their rivals from countries like RussiaThey simply havent had the time to finetune their triples mostly because they started trying them so lateThat rule Auxier said was rescinded several years ago under his watch There is also a relatively new scoring system of bonus points that gives incentives to young skaters who try jumps like triples and double axelsI think postOlympics when the next generation comes up well see more difficulty on the technical side from our skaters Auxier said Its possible that well get back on the podium in the next couple of years but sometimes life and puberty get in the wayThere has also been a push to open centralized training sites where skaters can work with top coaches but also train next to top skaters That system works Just ask the RussiansZagitova 15 and her Russian teammate Evgenia Medvedeva who is 18 and was second in the short program are proof They train together and compete against each other every day Medvedeva described the arrangement as a motivational toolYou feel so strange because you are older and you must be stronger than them Medvedeva saidEvery competition she added is a little warIn the Russian view the best way to ace the Olympic test is to pass all the quizzes along the way That is not a guarantee though that American skating  a fiercely independent ecosystem  will ever embrace the centralized modelMost coaches in the United States hang their own shingle out and they dont want anybody touching their skater said Paul Wylie the 1992 Olympic silver medalist They dont want to share any information with anybody and its a very oldschool mentalitySome skating clubs around the country including the Broadmoor Skating Club in Colorado Springs where Nagasu trains have been informally creating their own working groups They arent statesponsored the way the Russians are They dont have free and constant access to an ice rink the way the Russians do But at least its a start on working together as a village to raise great skatersIts a much better start than the Americans had on WednesdayNagasu said she came out with too much adrenaline and overrotated her axel causing her to fall A little tiny error she said Chen said her nerves got to her producing a shaky first jump Tennell also blamed the pressure and said she couldnt remember the last time she had fallen on a jumpWhat they do is harder than it looks And they will all do it again on Friday when they hope their routines will be fallfree and close to perfect  or at minimum just plain routineEmail

cultural institutions and their Make Italy Great Again vision highlights museums as much as migration policy For Mr Salvinis party the nationalist project goes right through the history of artUnlike in Germany where the Nazi regime policed strict aesthetic boundaries Benito Mussolini did not impose a style on Italys artists after he came to power in 1922 Culture was to be in the service of a rejuvenated state but it could take any number of forms  from the abstraction of the secondgeneration Futurists to the classical figuration of painters espousing a return to order How were these artists shaped by the politics of their time And how in turn did these artists many of whom eagerly supported the Fascist regime participate in the construction of a new Italian iconographyA colorstarved still life of bottles on a table by Morandi who made a quiet peace with Fascism appears just as it did in a 1921 exhibition It gives onto the hideous mockclassicist marble busts of Adolfo Wildt who stole the show at the 1922 Venice Biennale and who would go on to sculpt Mussolini with the intensity of a Roman emperor We then see Di Chiricos pictures of stringy barebottom gladiators as they were displayed in a Paris apartment and a Roman museum populated by gross classicized athletes and nymphsInstead of the false clarity of the white cube Post Zang Tumb Tuuum gives us a plural kaleidoscopic view of the decades of Il Duce You watch helplessly as the avantgarde hardens into agitprop and see how even the most stolid of styles could be complicit in horrorIt also erases the distinction between elite exhibitions and popular manifestations  above all when you reach Fondazione Pradas huge Deposito or warehouse where Mr Celant projects dozens of installation shots from the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution which opened in Rome in 1932 for the 10th anniversary of the regime This epic show drawing nearly four million visitors rewrote Italys political history as a hybrid of sacred ceremony and love affair with the leader Cantilevered walls plastered with Fascist slogans and clippings from Il Popolo dItalia Mussolinis newspaper gave way to stylized statues of the regimes brawny new men It concluded with a Shrine to the Fallen dominated by a massive crucifix and blinding lightPicking up where Fondazione Pradas show ends is Dawn of a Nation at Palazzo Strozzi in Florence a less ambitious exhibition that nevertheless offers an effective window onto Italian art amid postwar reconstruction Unlike Post Zang Tumb Tuuum it limits documentary material to an initial gallery where a newsreel montage takes us from the foundation of the republic in 1946 to the dolce vita of the 1960sThe past was not forgotten in this postwar age Mimmo Rotella whose canvases comprised multiple posters sliced in the technique known as dcollage found an old Mussolini placard beneath an advertisement for a swordsandsandals epic film But the economic boom of the 1950s occasioned a new freedom in Italian art A beautiful gallery here unites two dozen paintings and sculptures of all white a slashed monochrome by Lucio Fontana a foam rubber canvas by Giulio Turcato and multiple achromatic works by Piero Manzoni whose white bread rolls rabbitfur balls and canned excrement mocked both artistic genius and rampant consumerismBy the late 1960s the Italian avantgarde had again become explicitly political though this time it spoke the languages of the left In Rome the Pop artist Mario Schifano painted boys toting hammers and sickles when he wasnt recording progrock or in jail on drugs charges And up in Turin a loose collection of young artists started to embrace humble everyday materials to challenge artistic hierarchies and eventually became known as Arte Povera The man who coined that term A young Germano Celant the curator of Post Zang Tumb TuuumDawn of a Nation closes with one of the most emblematic works of Arte Povera Giuseppe Penones Rovesciare i Propri Occhi Reversing Ones Eyes from 1970 in which the artist photographed himself wearing mirrored contact lenses blinding himself and reflecting the world he usually saw back onto the viewer The curators of Dawn of a Nation make the eyebrowraising proposition that Mr Penones photograph symbolizes a nation gazing introspectively at itself and its history as it enters the period of critical tension  that is to say the violent years of the 1970s That is a pretty desperate projection onto Mr Penones intricate sensetriggering art and when contrasted with the extreme precision of Post Zang Tumb Tuuum it feels especially baselessIn any event another work in Dawn of a Nation more explicitly encapsulates the tangled web of art and politics here In Luciano Fabros Italy 1968 a steel cutout of the boot of Europes south hangs from the ceiling but the wrong way up a supporting wire stretches around Calabria and Piedmont dangles down to the floor It sways and swings like an airdried prosciutto  or indeed like the body of Mussolini hanging upsidedown in a Milan square in 1945Especially after March 4 as its citizens await to discover what sort of new government they will get Fabros Italy feels familiar again a portrait of a country both exquisite and hamstrungAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,politics

the norm  and so are the odds for her candidate Lindsey Davis Stover running in her first raceBut Ms Brown is undeterred She has a strategy for her candidate to prevail in a deeply tactical primary through hypercoordination among events digital strategy mail television and radioMs Brown is only 24They will have the potential to reshape a profession long dominated by menThis year 40 percent of the campaign managers for Democratic congressional candidates are women according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee In contrast Kelly Dittmar a political scientist at Rutgers Universitys Center for American Women and Politics recalled excising data on female campaign consultants from a book she wrote in 2010 because the numbers were too small to be statistically reliableFor years women were the fundraisers and the communications people said Anita Dunn a Democratic consultant and former communications director for President Barack Obama But when it was the bigboy decisions there werent women in the roomThat is changing Ms Brown alone is in regular contact with a halfdozen other young women managing congressional campaignsRepublicans have their analogues to Ms Brown though in smaller numbersBecky Alery 31 is managing her first campaign for Representative Jason Lewis of Minnesota She said she was drawn to the candidate in part because of the strong women in his life and the many who serve in top staff roles on Capitol HillI worked my butt off to get here And I have had good support along the way she said including from several men she said were mentors I really do think it is going to take women standing up for themselves and men supporting themWhile many 24yearolds are finding their way in an entrylevel job Ms Brown is managing a campaign staff volunteers and a candidate who is 15 years her senior She rarely sees her friends or family she saidThey think I am insane Ms Brown said I am doing something very different than most of themAfter Ms Brown graduated in spring 2016 from Colby College in Maine she packed her things and drove to Cleveland to volunteer for the Clinton campaign She was quickly hired as a field organizer and walked precincts talked to voters and worked on turnout After the campaign she assumed she would get a job in strategic communications or maybe journalism but Mrs Clintons loss made her believe she had to stay in politics and work to elect womenI really revisited my values and thought to myself I could move to a firm or go in another direction Ms Brown said But if this is about to be as bad as we think it is going to be I want to be able to look back and say I did everything I could when our country was threatenedMs Browns success made an impression on Ms Davis Stover a former chief of staff to a Democratic congressman who is running against Representative Barbara Comstock one of the most vulnerable House RepublicansI wanted a woman to run our race Ms Davis Stover said I wanted Emma because shes intelligent shes compassionate shes driven I wanted someone with grit to walk through the fireMs Brown said young female campaign managers like her can hold that space for other womenWe talk a lot about how male managers come in and theres this respect she said Women managers come in and they have to earn itMs Brown said she has felt the sting of sexism Men have questioned whether she was really a campaign manager She has been told she would have to wait her turn And there has been the notsosubtle when did you graduate from college question to discern her ageShe uses that as motivation I feel very compelled to the front lines of electoral politics and electing women in particular in the Trump era Ms Brown saidMs Dittmar of Rutgers said women who run campaigns are critical as the key players in drafting a plan drafting a message and a platformThe people you have at that table when making those decisions should be as diverse as the constituency that you are trying to

including several on the presidential level but managing a race was still more the exception than the ruleMs Brown said she and the other women running campaigns know that their opportunity was borne of Mrs Clintons lossHillary opened up this space for women Ms Brown said If she had won I dont know if any of this would be happening I dont know if MeToo would have happened I would give my right arm

AdvertisementSupported byOpEd ContributorMs Lindseylives in Rabat Morocco and cohosts the BULAQ podcastIn Muslim countries laws governing inheritance are derived from verses in the Quran men generally receive larger sometimes double the shares that women get Distant male relatives can supersede wives sisters and daughters leaving women not just bereaved but also destituteRaising the issue of inheritance and inequality has long been considered blasphemous When Tunisias modernizing first president Habib Bourguiba did so in 1974 he was targeted by a fatwa from a Saudi cleric and forced to backtrackYet recently in several North African countries the debate over equality in inheritance has been picking up steamLast summer President Beji Caid Essebsiof Tunisia created a commission to study how to institute an equitable inheritance law Recently a couple of thousand demonstrators gathered in downtown Tunis the capital to encourage him to follow through In Morocco where I live the National Council on Human Rights in 2015 recommended instituting equality in inheritance it was browbeaten by Islamists but the topic hasnt gone awayAnd in January the Moroccan government took a symbolic but important step It announced that women would be allowed to become adouls traditional notaries who witness acts of marriage divorce and inheritance Opening this profession to women Ms Lamrabet told me at the time brought women a step closer to equality and to the legal and religious authority from which they have been traditionally excluded across the Muslim Arab worldMs Lamrabet is one of a small group of women who have staked a claim to exercising that authority Patriarchy is this to refuse women authority over religious texts she told me One of our demands is to accept womens readings of religious texts and let women be religious authoritiesI first met Ms Lamrabet last fall in her office at the Mohammedan League of Scholars a stately building decorated with traditional stucco molding tiles and wooden latticework The league is Moroccos preeminent official institution of religious scholarship and Ms Lamrabets presence within it was in and of itself remarkableWhen Ms Lamrabet rejects practices such as polygamy unequal access to divorce or a husbands authority over his wife she either shows there is no textual basis at all in the Quran for these practices or she argues that the historical context needs to be taken into account when interpreting what the text saysWith regard to inheritance Ms Lamrabet and others note that women were allotted a smaller share on the assumption that male relatives would provide for all their material needs That is no longer the case many households in Morocco today depend largely on a womans income So Ms Lamrabet argues that the law should be reevaluated on the basis of the Qurans original spirit of justice and fairnessBut apparently making this argument repeatedly and publicly was too much for the religious establishment in MoroccoMs Lamrabet says her goal is the deconstruction of religious patriarchy She argues from a religious basis because she told me religion is the No 1 weapon used against women in her country today She wants to furnish women with arguments with which to reclaim their religion and to reject inequality and discrimination in the name of IslamBut she is also critical of the way womens rights have been deployed by Western powers to justify colonialism military intervention and attacks on her religion Her arguments will displease both Muslim conservatives who see feminism as an immoral unnecessary foreign import and those who believe womens subjugation is a unique and unchangeable feature of IslamMs Lamrabet is part of a school of thought often referred to as Islamic feminism  which includes the late great Moroccan sociologist Fatema Mernissi and scholars such as Amina Wadud and Leila Ahmed She is also part of a larger field of activists artists and intellectuals trying to articulate a feminist third way  one that doesnt have to choose between religion and universal rights between critiquing the West and kowtowing to local conservativesThe broaching of inheritance reform  which would be a truly revolutionary change  is taking place as a number of Arab countries are giving women new legal rights In Tunisia Muslim women will be allowed to marry nonMuslim men in most Muslim countries only men are allowed to marry outside their religion Lebanon is the latest country in the region to outlaw the practice of rapists being exonerated for their crime by marrying their victims Even in Saudi Arabia the authorities have announced that women will finally be granted the right to drive as well as to set up their own businesses without a male guardians consentSkepticism over these announcements is sometimes warranted Male rulers and autocrats in the region have figured out that branding themselves champions of womens rights is a winning PR move in the West  but even enlightened rulers are unlikely to undermine a religious discourse from which they derive much of their own legitimacy And legal reforms that favor women are only as strong as the rule of law over all Even as we celebrate every gain that makes womens lives better what counts most is the degree to which women are able to voice and to advance their own arguments for equalityThe debate over womens rights and Islam is so politicized and riddled with stereotypes that it is extremely hard to write about Muslim women are not all victims renegades or standardbearers for religious or cultural authenticity They are not foils with which to bash Islam or through which sympathetic Westerners can congratulate themselves on their cultural superiorityTrue solidarity with women in this part of the world means paying less attention to selfserving male rulers and to cosmetic official initiatives and more to the lively often contentious debate taking place within Muslim societies to the diverse voices of women here and to their ideas of how they want to advance their own cause These voices are secular and religious young and old they are also often critical of Western policies in the regionInheritance inequality Ms Lamrabet told me is part of an ideology that assumes that women are worth less and deserve less She and others will continue to insist that women get their fair shareUrsula Lindsey writes about culture and politics in the Arab worldAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,politics
He has been president for more than a year  so why is he still holding ralliesSaccone took the stage briefly before Trump did and his people were circulating in the hangar normallooking suburban Republican operatives and volunteers of the sort who are still jarring to see attached to the Trump roadshow like insuranceclaims adjusters piled into the bed of a monster truck But this was a Trump event in spirit the email advisory from Donald J Trump for President Inc his official presidential campaign committee described it as a campaign rally but did not mention Saccone explaining instead that Trump would highlight the benefits that his historic tax cuts are providing hardworking families across Pennsylvania and to celebrate our booming economy now that America is once again open for business Onstage Trump seemed to intermittently remember the tax cuts and the booming economy and even more intermittently that he was supposed to be promoting the candidate whom he had reportedly derided in private as weak But he mostly did what he usually does at his rallies recite the latest verse of the ballad of Donald Trump the president who would be doing great things for the people in this room were it not for his many antagonistsThis evening he was talking about Peggy Noonan the conservative Wall Street Journal columnist Shes a Bushie an older man next to me yelled scornfully Noonan had apparently written something or more likely said something on cable news where she appears often as a pearlnecklaced avatar of political normalcy about Trumps appearing inadequately presidential Im very presidential Trump told us with mock indignation Then he stiffened in his suit and adopted a stentorian tone like a fourth grader doing an impression of his school principal Laaaadies and gentlemen he intoned thank you for being here tonight Rick Saccone will be a great great congressman He will help me very much Hes a fine man and Yong is a wonderful wife I just want to tell you on behalf of the United States of America that we appreciate your service And to all of the military out there we respect you very much Thank you Thank you He broke character for a second And then you go God bless you and God bless the United States of America thank you very much He turned and faced the VIP guests in the riser behind him and did a sort of rigid penguin walkThe crowd whooped and laughed  not the cruel laughter you come to know at Trump rallies but real belly laughter for what was a genuinely funny bit Trump who loves nothing more than being loved kept penguinwalking and everyone kept laughing It took a few more seconds for the spectacular strangeness of the moment to settle in We were watching a sitting American president imitating an American presidentAdvertisementExcept now he wasnt Watching Trump step into the archetype momentarily and then just as quickly step out it hit me Even in Trumps mind that president was someone else somewhere else It was as if I were sitting on a commercial flight at cruising altitude when the pilot suddenly plopped down in the next seat commiserated about the tarmac delays and poor inflight service then popped an Ambien and went to sleepAdvertisementBy the time the first dates of the tour were announced on Nov 29 it had been tactfully rechristened a thankyou tour nine rallies in nine states throughout December I was with the advance team yesterday and theyre showing me all the different places hes going in the next two weeks Anthony Scaramucci at the time a member of the executive committee of Trumps transition team told the Fox Business Networks Maria Bartiromo This is a guy who doesnt give upHe didnt After taking a few weeks in January and February to be inaugurated and acquaint himself with the business of running the country Trump held another rally He has been holding them regularly ever since sometimes as often as twice a month His itinerary has not once diverged from the states on his electoral map he had been to the exact same hangar in Moon two days before winning Pennsylvania in 2016 There have been 20 rallies in all give or take a couple that might be construed as more conventional presidential appearances  though it is hard for even these to not take on the character of a Trump rally when he takes the stage They amount to one of the few sustained continuous projects of his presidency and represent a genuinely novel contribution to the theater of American politics a Basement Tapes of the Trump years a neverending tour with stakes perpetually hazy and unclearFrom the beginning I thought it would be important to witness these rallies and I went as often as I could Whenever I did I was confronted with the question of what it was precisely that I expected to witness Was it the people who turned out to see him I was curious at first who they would be  who would show up for what were in effect campaign rallies for a campaign that ended months ago I interviewed them diligently filling notebooksI walked in here somebody told me to expletive off Im a Nazi cause Im going in here This guy outside he says Nazis should die OK Im with you Im on the same side Im not a expletive NaziI liked everybody but Trump and Ted Cruz But because he was our nominee I voted for him Ive warmed up to him I just wish he would uh calm it down a little bit With the tweetingBut youve read all this before havent you The spectrum of people at these rallies was not appreciably different from the spectrum at Trumps actual campaign rallies which was itself fairly representative of the broader rallygoing Republican electorate in 2016  and interviewing people at campaign events as every reporter believes secretly but is not allowed to admit is almost always a waste of time for everyone involved in the exchange like asking Mets fans at a Mets game why they like the MetsThese rallies rarely produced news and what news they produced was usually limited to something Trump said which meant you could just as easily cover it from the comfort of your own couch thanks to the handful of livebroadcasting TV crews that was always packed onto a riser in the back of the venue These people served double duty as a hate totem for the events the most reliable targets for ritual humiliation from the stage Huddled around their tripods buffeted by thousands of boos and obscenities they called to mind weathercasters lashed to telephone poles earlyDan Ratherstyle in a hurricane Their footage chopped up and YouTubed and GIFed and John Olivered would be injected into the infinitely subdividing capillaries of socialmedia outrage in near real time Sometimes at the rallies I would look at these camera crews and then open Twitter on my phone watch it welling up with cascades of disbelief at whichever deliberately disbeliefinducing thing Trump had just said and wonder what the point of any of us being there wasOnly a man like this could conceive of a permanent campaign extending infinitely after Election Day as something desirable From the first the postelection rallies were bemoaned as at best a waste of presidential time but this missed their peculiar intimacy To feel as if you were witnessing something essential and true about Barack Obama you would have had to see him alone in his study late at night To witness the same of Trump you have to stand among thousands gathered to see him  and see him seeing you seeing himAdvertisementThis was in Melbourne Fla last February  Trumps first rally after taking office He was in MaraLago mode opencollared and visibly at ease more so than he had been at any point since Inauguration Day Five days earlier Michael Flynn his national security adviser had resigned over Flynns contacts with Russian officials and Trump had asked the FBI director James Comey to stop investigating him One of the largest singleday demonstrations in American history had been staged in protest of Trump  less as a president than as a human being  dwarfing his own inaugurations attendance His travel ban was gummed up in federal court But this wasnt Washington or the Fourth Circuit it was Florida my second home as Trump had described it Come here  let him up Im not worried about him he said as the man made his way to the stage Hop over the fence He can do it  look this guys in great shape This guy is great  dont worry about himThe mans name it would later be ascertained was Gene Huber He was a car salesman from Boynton Beach very tan with a closecropped corona of graying hair in good shape just as the president said wearing a commemorative Tshirt from Trumps inauguration featuring the same presidential seal as the lectern behind which he now embraced Trump in a bear hug This guy Hes been all over television saying the best things Trump said Say a couple wordsMr President thank you sir Huber said slightly wildeyed with adrenaline looking not at Trump but at the cameras We the people our movement is the reason why our president of the United States is standing in front of us today When President Trump during the election promised all these things he was going to do for us I knew he was going to do this for usIt is great to be back in the incredible beautiful great state of Iowa Trump said as he took the stage in Cedar Rapids the following evening Home of the greatest wrestlers in the world including our friend Dan Gable  some of the great great wrestlers of the world right We love those wrestlersIt was five months into his presidency by then and five rallies In Nashville in March Trump railed against the judge in Hawaii who issued an injunction against his revised travel ban  This ruling makes us look weak  and against his own staff which had advised him to revise it in the first place Five days later the same day James Comey was testifying before the House Intelligence Committee about Russian interference in the 2016 election Trump was at another rally this time in Louisville Ky talking about Colin Kaepernick There was an article today that reported that NFL owners dont want to pick him up because they dont want to get a nasty tweet from Donald TrumpThe rallies had ceased to be the curiosity they were at first Out of basic psychological necessity if nothing else the country was learning to metabolize the Trump presidencys daily news barrage of which the rallies were but one minor component another assaultive stream of words and images entering the public consciousness in a disembodied decontextualized way Here was Trump shouting somewhere At the events you would be reminded with some surprise that these moments occurred at fixed coordinates in space and time as opposed to simply materializing in the news cycle in which the country was now trapped 24 hours a day by virtue of Trumps own unwavering attention to itPlease verify youre not a robot by clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter to subscribe toView all New York Times newslettersThe texture of this was familiar to anyone who watched Trump during the campaign The conventional speech was there nominally a formal structure around which Trump improvised embroidering it with anecdotes that may or may not have happened turning over parts of the speech in the light and opening up the back end of it to show the audience to let them in on the secrets to convey a sense that he was leveling with the people who had the good sense to be there at that moment offering a sensation of truth if not always the complete thing Iowas state healthinsurance exchange had lost most of its providers but not all of them It was fun to listen to because Trump  and this is still perhaps the most incredible thing about his candidacy in retrospect  was somehow the first politician in however many decades of modern American political oratory to capitalize on the fact that nobody likes listening to modern American political oratoryAdvertisementThere was also a dissonance to these speeches however now that Trump had settled into his presidency Before the election his subversion of the forms of American politics served to underscore the basic argument of his campaign which was that Americas problems could be solved easily if you overthrew the countrys governing class with all their idiocies of convention But Trump and his voters had done exactly that and Americas problems had not instantly disappeared One of Trumps more reliable impulses is evading responsibility and he spent much of these speeches herding together the scapegoats  the media the recalcitrant Democrats the FBI the system  who might account for his situation without appearing to realize that he was drawing the selfportrait of a man who had wanted power but gotten authority insteadThe afternoon before the rally I was settling into my seat in an American Airlines Airbus on the runway in Charlotte NC when the pilot got on the intercom If everyone could take their seats quickly please he said a note of apologetic bewilderment in his voice were trying to beat Air Force One into Phoenix today Trump he explained was due into Phoenix around the same time we were If we dont get in ahead of them were going to be put in a holding patternA groan went up from the passengers I got held up in Florida by Air Force One for four hours a woman sitting behind me grumbledAcross the aisle an older man was saying something about Joe Biden and his Secret Service entourage taking up whole cars on Amtrak between Washington and Wilmington Im just saying he protested both sides do this And so we hurtled west in our climatecontrolled specimen vial of the national argument trying desperately to outrun the man at the center of itIt was 107 degrees in Phoenix and outside the downtown convention center paramedics with IV bags balanced on their shoulders were tending to rallygoers who had succumbed to the heat an elderly woman in a Hawaiian shirt had toppled out of the VIP line and was vomiting on the pavement Inside I passed a man wearing pleated khaki slacks and a sweatdrenched sleeveless undershirt with an American flag draped over his shoulders serapestyle as if he were on his way to see Mad Maxs keynote address at CPAC It was possible that the events in Charlottesville had depressed turnout but it seemed just as possible that it was the heat and the prospect of waiting outside for hours in it to file into a convention center that when I got inside was full but not packed as other rallies had beenTrump recited from all of his postCharlottesville news releases he had them printed out I said Racism is evil Now they only choose you know like a half a sentence here or there and then they just go on this long rampage or they put on these real lightweights all around a table that nobody ever heard of and they all say what a bad guy I am But I mean do you ever see anything  and then you wonder why CNN is doing relatively poorly in the ratings Because theyre putting like seven people all negative on Trump And they fired Jeffrey Lord  poor Jeffrey Jeffrey LordAdvertisementThe crowd cheered for its newfound elitism but the energy in the room was sagging palpably It had been a long hot day They were still heckling the TV people in the media pen but it felt unfocused pro forma So the point is  and I didnt want to bore you because you understand where Im coming from You people understand But the point is that those were three different  there were two statements and one news conference The words were perfect They only take out anything they can think of and for the most part all they do is complain But they dont put on those words And they dont put on me saying those wordsThe adjective I instinctively reached for watching it was Nixonian but even Nixon generally confined this kind of thing to the White House tapes Trumps very public spleenventing more closely resembled that of Andrew Johnson Abraham Lincolns vice president and the reluctant and disastrous steward of Reconstruction after his death In February 1866 after Congress tried and failed to override Johnsons veto of a law providing federal protections for freed slaves he gave an impromptu speech to his supporters in which he compared his Senate antagonists to Confederate generals fulminated about supposed assassination plots against him and in the space of barely an hour used his own name more than 200 times Congress impeached him two years laterThis was a Castro speech in length Rick Wilson the Republican strategist was saying on the CNNequipped flat screens at the Phoenix airport as I waited for my flight home It was an astounding chain of lies tied together by a man who obviously is mentally unstable David Jolly the former Republican congressman from Florida told MSNBCs Chris Hayes the next day Listen there is no moral equivalency between this president and some of the dictators weve seen in the Dark Ages of the Middle East and other places around the globe But the politics of some of those dark dictators was to always have an enemy And that is what this president has modernizedIt is true that it is hard to get through a Trump rally now without thinking of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte Turkeys Recep Tayyip Erdogan or the other authoritarians for whom Trump has openly expressed his admiration And yet watching Trump onstage in Phoenix the instincts he was following seemed to be much more those of an entertainer than those of a demagogue It had the feel of being in the studio audience for an unusually angry latenight hosts opening monologue He was a guy on a stage improvising trying to hold the crowd toggling between the riskier material and the easy applause lines trying to figure out what they liked and how to give them more of it The applause for clean coal was tepid so he moved on to Joe Arpaio He talked about Jonathan Gruber the economist who helped design the Affordable Care Act but no one seemed to know who that was so he reached into the tangle of Fox News chyrons balled up in the back of his head and came up with something about all the people who wanted to tear down George Washington statues and the crowd roared its indignation at this movement that did not in any meaningful sense existThese moments have political consequences but when you are watching them in person the imperatives at play seem mostly emotional the needs on display are raw and visible and curiously small But then you see the same speech on a screen outside the realityimpeding Faraday cage of the rally venue and you are reminded that this is the president that he commands a nuclear arsenal and a legal system that can put people in jail or throw them out of the country and a surveillance apparatus of godlike omniscience and an unshakably loyal third at least of the American population The man is trying for The Tonight Show and it comes out as Hugo Chavezs Al PresidenteTrump does not speak to history except in extremely rare cases like his Inaugural Address or his State of the Union address in which circumstances absolutely nonnegotiably force him to do so Otherwise he is always speaking to a proximate audience unlike other presidents the speaking not the speech is the point The words would make little sense without their immediate social context To be a member of his audience is to feel valued part of an intimate and privileged you defined in relation to some broader population Gene Hubers we the people rather than the

ProfileIn the Distance by Hernn Diaz is a weird western about a lonely Swede traveling Americas frontier in the 1800s Its very goodSupported byHkan Sderstrm the hulking hero of Hernn Diazs novel In the Distance makes a stupendous entrance ascending onto the first page through a starshaped void on a featureless plain of white sea ice Longhaired whitebearded gnarled and naked he pulls himself onto the floe and walks on bow legs to an icebound schooner carrying a rifle and ax We are somewhere nowhere in the frozen northNowhere is also the place In the Distance Mr Diazs first novel seems to have erupted from He had no agent when he answered an open call for manuscripts by the nonprofit Coffee House Press in Minneapolis which published the novel last October In April Mr Diaz was named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the PENFaulkner Award for Fiction causing book reviewers around the country to say whoMr Diaz is a scholar at Columbia University who grew up in Argentina and Sweden studied in London and New York and lives in Brooklyn His book is about an immigrant Swede of unusual size journeying in Americas desert frontier between the Gold Rush and the Civil WarThough many of its elements are familiar to the point of being worn out  saloons and wagon trains Indians and gold prospectors  the novel is not Mr Diazs long study of North American literature much of it steeped in the 19th century allowed him to expertly plunder an antique genre for parts The rebuilt mechanism is his own design and it moves in unexpected directions west to east around in circles down into the earth and north to AlaskaWhich makes In the Distance an uncanny achievement an original westernHes standing on the shoulders of a lot of giants said Chris Fischbach publisher of Coffee House Press and Mr Diazs editor Its a modernist book in that hes absorbing all these fragments and using those to create a new world and a new piece of artIn a recent interview in a sunny Brooklyn Heights apartment that Mr Diaz shares with his wife Anne a filmmaker and their daughter Elsa 7 he talked about the bafflement that led him to HkanIts weird he said Weird that the western novel was so underachieving given how tightly the genre embraces Americas most potent myths about itself Westerns he said glamorize the worst aspects of the imperial drive of the United States  brutality against nature genocidal racism the whole macho thing the place of women the frivolous violence it goes onMr Diaz it should be clear is a western writer who hates guns He said it sickened him to think that telling Hkans story would require imagining and describing acts of murderous violence I came very close to not writing the book he said But I knew something really bad had to happen to him to make the plot plausibleHkan is a backwoods boy from Sweden who leaves home with his older brother Linus for the American metropolis they call Nujrk But he loses Linus on a wharf in Portsmouth England boards the wrong ship and ends up in San Francisco He resolves to reunite with his brother by trudging across the continent shoes against the current of westward migration and continental conquestHe knows no English and for a time the reader is almost as disoriented as Hkan is Stray words float by in a river of frontier gibberish Frawder thur prueless rare shur per thurst Mirtler freckling thow But Hkan learns fast He meets people a mystery woman in a corset with amber hair and blackred lips like a hooker with a heart of coal A demented gold miner An obsessive naturalist who wades in alkaline pools for imagined protoorganisms Homesteaders marauding Civil War veterans and a sinister sheriffHkan starves and thirsts He survives and grows in sorrowful wisdom and inexplicably to colossal size And though he murders and maims and becomes a notorious outlaw he is disgusted and ultimately shattered by his violenceThe reader absorbed has urgent questions Will the misdirected Hkan ford the Mississippi and pass Huck Finn lighting out the other way Will he find Linus in the sooty hubbub of Walt Whitmans Brooklyn or the immigrant maelstrom of Five Points How does he end up in AlaskaMore immediately how do you pronounce HkanMake a fish mouth and glide over the vowels Huohaahkkan To Mr Diaz it sounds like a Long Islander saying Hawk can which is pretty close for someone whose roots are from nowhere near MassapequaHe was born in Buenos Aires in 1973 His mother was a psychoanalyst his father a filmmaker who became involved in Trotskyist politics which put the family in danger after Argentinas military coup when Hernn was 2 They fled to Stockholm Moving there and then back to Argentina as a boy gave Mr Diaz double doses of immigrant dislocation the emotional aftereffect of isolation and bullying seem to echo in his story of lonely HkanAmong the ideas Mr Diaz challenges with In the Distance is the one that writing convincingly about a place requires going there at some pointHe didnt No rental car and GPS for him There was something that to me felt corrupt and dishonest about having an airconditioned experience of the protagonists ordeals he said I defend the idea of reading over researching which has this whole protocol that I dont think applies to literature which has its own relationship to truthMr Diaz considered the risks of historical howlers Kafka imagined the Statue of Liberty holding a sword and found them tolerable What he concocted is strange and transporting a story that approaches but never enters the realm of magical realism Hkan is one humongous Swede but not a biblical giant On a bigenough horse to match his proportions he can plod down Main Street without causing panicSome characters stray toward anachronism like the opulent winemaker a sort of Finnish Francis Ford Coppola who lives on a groomed estate out of Architectural Digest or Asa the good guy in a bad gang who loves to cook Asa is a frontier foodie adding sweet sap and blossoms to his dishes He shares with Hkan a few ambiguously tender scenes of manly attachment and his recipe for quail stewWeird But give Mr Diaz this Its a weirdness to which a reader willingly submits because of the vigorous beauty of his words and his ability to keep Hkans bizarre adventures somewhere within sight of possibility So when you get to a sentence like this  Hkan tried to milk the lion  it passes without a second thoughtAn affecting oddness is the great virtue of In the Distance along with its wrenching evocations of its main characters loneliness and grief And its ability to create lustrous mindscapes from wideopen spaces from voids that are never emptyIt all could plausibly happen Mr Fischbach said It probably wouldntLawrence Downes a writer and editor covered

AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON  For the second time this term the Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday about whether voting maps can be so distorted by politics that they violate the ConstitutionAs they had when an earlier case was argued in October many of the justices agreed that partisan gerrymandering is a serious problem that disfigures democracy But there was no indication on Wednesday that they had come to an agreement about whether the courts can address the problemIt seems like a pretty clear violation of the Constitution in some form to have deliberate extreme gerrymandering Justice Stephen G Breyer said But is there a practical remedy that wont get judges involved in dozens and dozens and dozens of very important political decisionsJustice Samuel A Alito Jr said that redistricting conducted by politicians was necessarily political Hasnt this court said time and again you cant take all consideration of partisan advantage out of districting he askedWere the Supreme Court to forbid taking account of politics in drawing voting maps he said I really dont see how any legislature will ever be able to redistrictThe justices largely agreed that the oddly shaped Maryland congressional district at issue drawn by Democrats in the Legislature was an extreme example of distasteful political gamesmanshipIt doesnt seem to have any internal logic Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr said of the district which stretches from northwestern Maryland to the Washington suburbs He added that the district had been redrawn in a way that prefers one party over anotherJustice Elena Kagan said it sometimes might be hard to tell when politics played too large a role but she said that was not a problem here However much you think is too much she said this case is too muchBut it was not at all clear that the court was prepared to say the Constitution may place limits on extreme partisan gerrymandering where the party in power draws voting districts to give itself an outsize advantage in future electionsThe Supreme Court has never struck down a voting district as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander A ruling allowing such challenges could revolutionize American politicsJustice Anthony M Kennedy who probably holds the crucial vote in both cases returned to a theme he had pursued in the arguments in the Wisconsin case asking whether a law that required partisan gerrymandering in so many words would violate the ConstitutionSteven M Sullivan Marylands solicitor general said it wouldJustice Kennedy asked How is this case different Mr Sullivan said the redistricting law did not expressly call for a partisan advantageJustice Kennedy was not satisfied So if you hide the evidence of what youre doing then youre going to prevail he askedIf there was a hint about where the court was headed in the Wisconsin case it came from Justice Breyer who suggested that the court schedule a new round of arguments in both cases along with one from North Carolina in the term that will start in October His question suggested that at least some of the challengers could not demonstrate that they had suffered the sort of direct injury that gave them standing to sueWhat would you think Justice Breyer asked of taking the three cases and setting them for reargument on the question of standing and there wed have all three variations in front of us he asked a lawyer for the challengers Michael B Kimberly But Justice Breyers real audience seemed to be his colleagues none of whom spoke up in support of the proposalJustice Breyer who seems ready to allow constitutional challenges based on partisan gerrymandering probably would not have made the suggestion had his views prevailed when the justices took their preliminary vote in the Wisconsin case in OctoberSeveral justices said the Maryland case was plagued by procedural and practical problemsJustices Ruth Bader Ginsburg said there was little reason for the court to rule now because its decision would come too late to affect the 2018 electionsIts much too late even if you were successful for there to be any change for the 2018 election Justice Ginsburg told Mr Kimberly Justice Kennedy seemed to agree Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the challengers had waited too long to file suitMr Kimberly representing the plaintiffs argued that Democratic state lawmakers there had redrawn a district in northwestern Maryland to retaliate against citizens who supported its longtime incumbent Representative Roscoe G Bartlett a Republican That retaliation he said violated the First Amendment by diluting their voting power in a district that had been controlled by RepublicansMr Bartlett had won his 2010 race by a margin of 28 percentage points In 2012 he lost to Representative John Delaney a Democrat by a 21point marginSeveral justices said the evidence of extreme partisan gerrymandering was strongPeople were very upfront about what they were trying to do here which was to create another Democratic district Justice Kagan said And they did thatIn the past some justices have said the court should stay out of such political disputes Others have said partisan gerrymanders may violate the ConstitutionJustice Kennedy has taken a middle position leaving the door to such challenges open a crack though he has never voted to sustain oneThe widespread nature of gerrymandering in modern politics is matched by the almost universal absence of those who will defend its negative effect on our democracy Judge Niemeyer said Indeed both Democrats and Republicans have decried it when wielded by their opponents but nonetheless continue to gerrymander in their own selfinterest when given the opportunityThe problem is cancerous he wrote undermining the fundamental tenets of our form of democracyAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,politics

on Saturday she showed that theres nothing this mother of three cant do But she didnt just kill the performance she also rewrote the book on black respectability politics She could have decided to play to the majoritywhite audience with a show that made it easier to forget cultural differences Or she could be herself Beyonc chose the latterIn putting on a show that celebrated the diversity of black people she conveyed that no matter how much fame or money she has she will refuse to divorce herself from black culture even the parts that are underappreciated disrespected or misunderstood by white people Beyonc was performing her music but she was also saying that the performance of respectability  the policing of black peoples behavior and appearance to better appeal to white people  is an oppression we dont need in our livesBlack musicians in particular have long been told how they should look and perform to sustain their success and be marketable to a larger audience That often meant that black artists distanced themselves from the things associated with black culture especially the things that might be coded as notrespectableReceive the days biggest conversations right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter Whitney Houston famously struggled under this weight At the urging of her mentor Clive Davis and others she wore glamorous clothes sang popdriven songs instead of RB and obeyed other unwritten social norms that circumscribed how she could live her life and express herselfBeyoncs mother Tina Lawson echoed this sentiment before her daughters performance I told Beyonc that I was afraid that the predominately white audience at Coachella would be confused by all of the black culture and black college culture because it was something that they might not get she wrote on InstagramBut Beyonc assuaged her fears I have worked very hard to get to the point where I have a true voice Ms Lawson recalls her daughter saying And at this point in my life and my career I have a responsibility to do whats best for the world and not what is most popularIt would have made sense if Beyonc decided to perform songs that were more culturally ambiguous as to not alienate the people she was hired to entertain However before a mostly white audience Beyonc sang Lift Every Voice widely regarded as the black national anthem That song melted into Formation her own problack anthem where she talks about loving Negro noses and positions herself as a black Bill GatesShe also amplified Malcolm Xs famous words about black women The most disrespected woman in America is the black woman The most unprotected person in America is the black woman The most neglected person in America is the black woman This centering of black womanhood is not what black people have been taught to do when given as much power and attention as Beyonc hasIt would have been reasonable to assume Beyonc would perform the entire show in a glamorous couture number like the Nefertitiinspired costume she came onstage in Respectability is also imagery Black people are told when we gain power and are under the gaze of the public we must always wear our most formal and elegant attireInstead with millions of people watching in the desert and online Beyonc reappeared in blue distressed denim shorts and a hoodie advertising a fake historically black college Success does not need to have a preferred style a black person does not have to wear a glamorous gown or a tailored suit to captivate the imagination of the public Beyonc shows that talent and discipline are enoughShe follows in the tradition of black performers like Michael Jackson and Tina Turner but she is unique in imagining blackness as something so big To Beyonc attending a historically black college is more than a niche experience coveted only by students and alumni Instead its something thematically paramount and worthy of an enormous stadiumYou might think that Beyoncs promotion of historically black colleges and their intellectual traditions also might have conflicted with her sexually charged songs like Partition and Drunk in Love Were taught that an intellectual being can never be sexual one This is especially true for black people who have been hypersexualized in media and daily life So it wouldnt have been odd for her to edit her sexuality to fit societys ideas of what it means to be proud black and smartNot at Coachella Beyonc performed her sensuality proudly in those songs making political statement that a person can be both intellectually rigorous and sexually expressiveAll black people should follow her lead and refuse to shrink blackness Black people often negotiate how much of ourselves we should show to make others comfortable Black people often feel the need to edit parts of our culture and upbringing for the sake of appearing respectable  that is of course until our music and style are appropriated by the very people we were attempting to not alienateBeyoncs Coachella performance suggests that as black peoples power grows we should intentionally amplify the culture that nurtured us This antirespectability politics that Beyonc brought to the stage is what transformed her performance into a political statementAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,politics

AdvertisementSupported byDr Kirchhoff helped lead a Pentagon group that integrates technology from startups into military missionsShould technologists prevent their tools from being used to wage warOther critics of Silicon ValleyPentagon partnerships have made a different argument not that collaboration risks compromising Silicon Valley values but that contact with the militarys inefficient processes would contaminate the fastmoving culture of Silicon ValleyBoth arguments misunderstand the nature of technology and the militarys role in accelerating the commercial ascendancy of the United States A closer relationship between Silicon Valley and the Pentagon is good for industry and for national security  as well as for the debate we as American citizens must have about how technology is used especially in warGoogles engineers should be applauded for raising questions about how the machinelearning algorithms they invented are employed in Project Maven Their aspiration that Google never build warfare technology or outsource the moral responsibility for using technology is a noble goal It would be morally convenient if technology for war could be cleaved so cleanly from technology for everything else But it cant beSilicon Valley is already at war in the sense that the broad classes of technology it invents for search storage and pattern recognition have inherent military uses The same machinelearning algorithms developed to categorize images on the internet can be used to identity terrorist activity Technology circulates between government and industry between times of peace and war in ways no corporate policy can turn on or offEngineers in Silicon Valley are learning what students of history have long known Technology often springs forth in unforeseen ways wreaking havoc in some cases and providing salvation in others Those who uncork the proverbial genie cannot control its future by decreeBut all hope for accountability is not lost The controversy over Project Maven is teaching us an important civics lesson about who governs technology Google exists in a democracy whose elected representatives ultimately decide whether to use force and through what means The best way to influence how the United States fights wars is not through company policy it is by the ballot boxBecause the United States military is a product of our democracy it aims to fight with precision and a focus on limiting harm to innocent civilians  to a far greater extent than is the case with other less democratic major powers The technology behind Project Maven promises to reduce collateral damage still further making any decision by Google to withhold it morally complexSince 2015 the Pentagons engagement with Silicon Valley has been conducted through a group called Defense Innovation Unit Experimental which I helped lead from 2016 until last year that integrates technology from startups into military missions The group arose not from the paranoid war room of Dr Strangelove but rather from the more prosaic reality that most innovation today  unlike that of two generations ago  takes place in the commercial sector not government labsApple and Google each have a market capitalization twice as large as that of the entire United States defense industry The only way the military can continue protecting our nation and preserving the relative peace the world has enjoyed since World War II is by integrating the newest technology into its systems Denying the military access to this technology would over time cripple it which would be calamitous for the nation and the worldA partnership with the Pentagon is also in companies interest Working on important tough military problems helps refine their products improving the global competitiveness of American industry Even beyond the usual incentives created by federal research and development which helped spur innovations like Siri and the internet there is value to the industry in having access to the militarys operational testing and unique data setsThe debate at Google is vital and timely Engineers everywhere should closely follow how the military uses new classes of technology and object if those uses violate our values But if the goal of Silicon Valley technologists is to wall themselves off from the Pentagons most pressing needs they must concede that this will hurt both our security and industrial strengthMoving past the current debate requires all sides to focus on the values we hold in common Those in uniform working to protect the nation from a threatening world are just as worried by how novel technologies could be misused as the engineers who create themThey also hold dear a motto of Dont be evil Their commitment to this ideal goes beyond a corporate code of conduct It begins with an oath to uphold the Constitution and a duty that may require the ultimate sacrifice to preserve our form of selfgovernment That is a powerful basis for

AdvertisementSupported byOpEd ContributorMs Reynolds studies Congress with an emphasis on how congressional rules and procedure affect domestic policy outcomesThere are certainly bills that have been killed by Democratic filibusters in this Congress  just as there was legislation torpedoed by Republican obstruction during the Obama administration The need to overcome a filibuster in the Senate on spending bills and the influence that gives Democrats was a primary cause of the protracted budget conflict that produced a brief government shutdown in JanuaryBut the greater cause of many Republican headaches is substantive divisions within the party Democrats leverage on spending bills has been enhanced by the fact that a bloc of Republicans especially in the House generally refuse to support large omnibus packages like the one Congress passed last month And on issues where Republicans are capable of legislating without Democratic involvement disagreements about how to proceed have been the major obstacle The failed effort to repeal Obamacare using a legislative process that did not require overcoming a filibuster threat stands as the clearest casualty of Republican divisions but it is not the only oneThis year it appears Republicans will forgo their chance at using the fasttrack reconciliation process to make cuts to welfare and other entitlement programs before the midterms despite calls from some party members to take up such a proposal Doing so would require getting both an initial budget blueprint and a substantive bill through a Senate where Republicans hold just 51 seats the prospects of success would likely be slim The filibuster isnt making that task hard a narrow Senate majority and the pressures of an election year areIntraparty divisions aside suppose the Senate were to eliminate the filibuster Key differences in the electoral environments faced by legislators in the two chambers mean the Senate would not simply turn into the House Senators serve longer terms and represent larger often more diverse populations than House members meaning their electoral incentives on a given piece of legislation are distinctiveTake for example the debate over the state and local tax deduction in Republicans tax bill Reaching a compromise on the exact nature of a change to that piece of the tax code was key to getting the bill through the House Republicans from states like New York and New Jersey who represent concentrated blocs of constituents who benefit from the deduction  all of whom would have to run for reelection less than a year after the bills passage  forced the issue high on Congresss agenda In the Senate on the other hand the topic though not absent from the debate entirely was not given as much attention Unlike the demands on some of their House colleagues there are simply fewer Republican senators  especially from blue states  whose statewide reelection efforts depend on support from voters for whom that issue was salientEven on areas where vote totals suggest that a Democratic filibuster has killed a Republican policy priority in this Congress it is difficult to know if members would have behaved exactly the same way if the threshold for passage was lowerThe Senate plagued by limited amendment opportunities of its own is by no means a beacon of open and deliberative process But to the extent that individual senators continue to have personal influence in the Senate the ability to use the filibuster to take bills hostage is one source of it The filibuster may be an easy target for Republicans irritated with the challenges of governing but its hardly their biggest obstacleAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,politics

AdvertisementSupported byOpEd ContributorWhen the Democratic candidate Conor Lamb began his race in a special election in Pennsylvanias 18th congressional district he faced headwinds of the type that caused horizontal snow in the noreaster last weekFor starters Donald Trump had won the district by 20 points in 2016 The district has been held by Republicans for most of the last 50 years Conservative super PACS were willing to spend millions  it ended up being around 10 million  to buy TV time to savage Mr LambThe incumbent Tim Murphy a conservative antiabortion Republican had a lock on reelection until The Pittsburgh PostGazette reported last year that he had urged his mistress to have an abortion Republican House leaders decided that Mr Murphy had to go He resigned in OctoberThe man Republicans chose as their candidate was Rick Saccone a Jurassicera conservative who boasted that he was Trump before Trump was TrumpThat apparently was a few Trumps too many for voters in the 18th which begins in the Pittsburgh suburbs and slithers its way in classic gerrymandering fashion through conservative small towns and rural areas toward the West Virginia borderIts no wonder that Mr Saccone entered the race as the favorite This race was Mr Saccones to lose  and darned if he didntThe problem with political campaigns is that they dont exist in theory but in fact Factors like the candidates personality can carry weight as does the effectiveness of his field effort and advertising And lest we forget his position on the issuesMr Saccone 60 was a wet blanket of a candidate without a scintilla of charisma He also didnt particularly care for campaigning organized few public rallies and rarely took to the streets to speak with voters He let the super PACS do the talking for him with saturation TV adsWhile Mr Saccone was a mediocre campaigner Mr Lamb was an excellent oneHe has a sterling allAmerican rsum Marine federal prosecutor scion of a politically prominent Democratic family from Mount Lebanon At 33 he had the stamina and the desire to knock on door after door He stopped wearing a suit and tie on block visits after one resident yelled Youre a Jehovahs Witness at him Mr Lamb yelled right back Im a CatholicThe race in the 18th morphed into a sidedoor referendum on Mr Trump and on Tuesday turnout was high in both red and blue portions of the districtMr Lambs strongest showing was in Allegheny County where suburban voters  including Republicans  provided him with votes Mr Saccone ran up his votes in the three outlying countiesTed Kopas a Democrat who is a Westmoreland County commissioner warned about finding national or even cosmic trends in analyzing Mr Lambs victoryBefore you get try to put too much theory into voters minds I think all the credit should go to Conor Lamb Mr Kopas said There is no substitute for a candidate who is willing to go everywhere and do anything He is the kind of person who when people meet him they like him Smart and articulate He is the picture of what people want to see in a congressmanVoters also liked his politics Last weekend Cecil Roberts president of the United Mine Workers reached deep into his bag of compound adjectives to declare at a Lamb rally Hes a Godfearing unionsupporting gunowning jobprotecting pensiondefending DemocratThe 18th has long been the anger zone of state politics populated by contrarians known mostly for their dislikes of social progressives of abortion of politicians from the east read Philadelphia of antigun dogooders  the list could go onWith the demise of coal and steel and ancillary industries we are witnessing the revenge of the working class according to someone who should knowDavid Levdansky was a state legislator from Allegheny County a prounion Democrat who served for 26 years until he was unseated by Mr Saccone in 2010 by 151 votes Two years later in a rematch Mr Saccone won again  by 112 votes The defeat still stingsWhat the collapse of core industries did was create a cadre of voters who as Mr Levdansky said mimicking these angry voters message We want change Give us change We want to punish the elected officials in officeTo Mr Levdansky Mr Saccone is a charlatan who specializes in feeding voters redmeat issues while supporting cuts in education and human services In the Pennsylvania House Mr Saccone introduced one bill to require schools to emblazon In God We Trust on every building and another to allow gun owners to carry concealed weapons without a permitPresident Trump stopped by the district for a rally on Saturday night at which he spent five minutes urging the crowd to support Mr Saccone and 70 minutes talking about himselfIf Mr Saccone prided himself on being a Trump clone Mr Lamb bears a striking resemblance to another successful Democratic Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey who is also prounion and antiabortion although Mr Lamb takes the position that while he is personally opposed to abortion the laws should not change Mr Caseys brand of politics and his niceguy persona work well in PennsylvaniaWhen he first ran for the Senate in 2006 Mr Casey won the 18th by 11 percentage points Its all the more impressive because the man he defeated was Rick Santorum another angry man come to think of it who represented the district until he quit to run for the SenateIn another era Mr Casey would be called a centrist Now hes too conservative for progressives and too liberal for conservatives The only people who like him are the votersMr Lamb does not meet the test of ideological purity sought by his partys progressive wing but the future of the party may rest upon Democrats like him who have the insight to understand Mr Trumps appeal and act accordingly Ivory Soap Democrats wont cut it in territory like the 18thOne additional note whoever wins should take only a shortterm lease on his district offices After all this storm and fury  not to mention the millions spent  the 18th in its current form is likely to disappear The state Supreme Court has redrawn all congressional district lines effective in the November election though Republicans have sued in federal court to overturn the redistrictingIn any case if Mr Lambs lead holds to keep his seat he will have to run again in the fall for a full twoyear term And although the image is still a little blurry the results of the latest political Rorschach test are in and it doesnt look good for Mr Trump or his partyTom Ferrick Jr is a reporter who has covered Pennsylvania government and politics since the

curdles much of our politics into a zerosum game of tribal loathing It is the predictable response to almost any new development significant or otherwise Whatever happens someones fury will most likely rise to meet it and in the right conditions it will gather quickly into an entire campaign of backlashLast July a Google engineer named James Damore wrote an internal memo criticizing what he saw as authoritarian diversity practices at the tech giant suggesting along the way that women and men might be biologically suited to different professional roles He was swiftly fired but the furor the episode created in Silicon Valley spilled rapidly outward While Google executives rushed to condemn the memo and reaffirm their commitment to an inclusive workplace altright provocateurs were embracing Damore as a political martyr harassed out of his job by an oppressive and hypocritical liberal machine What began as a question of corporate values quickly transformed into a larger skirmish between competing perceptions of who actually wields power in AmericaDamore would go on to file a classaction suit claiming that conservative white men were systematically discriminated against at Google including as evidence colleagues aggressive responses to his memo  a reaction The Guardian characterized as an internal backlash Many of Damores coworkers of course had credibly argued that the only systematic discrimination here was found in Damores memo itself You have just created a textbook hostile workplace environment wrote one former colleague upon reading it The Financial Times saw

in any number of contentious issues One faction positions itself as a beleaguered voice of dissent bravely pushing back against some draconian orthodoxy The other sees itself as battling a society already suffused in this supposedly dissenting viewpoint Each side looks at the world around it and sees for the most part the flourishing of the other Its less a culture war than a war over whos already winningAdvertisementIt is a popculture law that everything generates a backlash The Ringer observed earlier this year before pointing out that the ensuing cycles of opinion  from initial hype to stubborn critiques to indignant defenses  were now so familiar they could be predicted with almost scientific precision It went on to do exactly that for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri a film about which you could eventually find some people arguing everyone loves this movie but I hate it and others declaring that everyone is criticizing this movie but theyre wrong  viewpoints that only grew more heated and highstakes as they dived into the films racial politicsYou didnt even need to be a popculture figure to get chewed up by these wild swerves of prevailing opinion For reasons that remain hard to discern a sweaterwearing man named Ken Bone became an internet hero after asking a question during a 2016 presidential debate  but after hearing of his past Reddit posts about pornography and the justified shooting of Trayvon Martin millions of people turned instantly from applauding this total stranger to mocking and denouncing him In an age of hyperpublic living every person company and brand is one tripwire away from a precipitous fall and a furious backlashNo matter how familiar the internet becomes with how all this works even seemingly manageable events will send the usual cycles repeating each more exaggerated than the last Its predictable that after the death of a political figure solemn eulogies will give way to vigorous criticism which will in turn occasion righteous defenses But you still might not have guessed that within 36 hours after the death of Barbara Bush the Womens March would be facing backlash for having tweeted Rest in peace and power and a college professor would be facing nationwide calls for her firing over tweets that called Bush racist and expressed pleasure in her death  each impulse it seems working hard to counter the prevalence of the otherAt the root of this analysis of course is the assumption that liberalism has been on a steady triumphant march  that a progressive ascendance sparks a conservative reaction It cannot be stressed too strongly Lipset wrote that backlash politics were a consequence of the fact that the United States is becoming more liberal But in 2016 it was the avatar of white conservative resentment who was elected president  a result the CNN commentator Van Jones described on election night as a whitelash And in the aftermath of this stark shift in government its clearly difficult for Americans to reach even a vague consensus on which ideological impulses are dominant and which are lashing out in response Many conservatives appear to have scarcely registered their political victories preferring instead to complain of a sinister deep state beyond executive control and resume their retaliatory campaigns against Hillary Clinton At the same time the backlash strategy has been handed off like a baton cropping up with greater frequency in descriptions of liberals energized by their opposition to TrumpCameron Tung is a freelance journalist from New York This is his first

AdvertisementSupported byOpEd ContributorMr Mller is a professor of politics at Princeton University and theauthor of Contesting Democracy Political Ideas in TwentiethCentury Europe among other booksOn Sunday Hungarys rightwing prime minister Viktor Orban is up for reelection possibly on track to his fourth term in office Mr Orban has spent the past several years weakening his countrys democratic checks and balances he has attacked independent civil society and he has brought the media under the control of oligarchs close to his government While doing so he has advertised his approach as a distinctive form of democracy one fit to meet the challenges of the 21st century It is he says illiberal democracyPlenty of critics have adopted this term as a description not just of Hungary but of redesigned political systems in countries as different as Poland and Turkey Yet illiberal democracy fails to capture what is wrong with these regimes It also gives leaders like Mr Orban a major rhetorical advantage He is still left with the designation democrat even as it is democracy itself  and not just liberalism  that is under attack in his countryIn the mid1990s observers started to notice that something was going wrong after the great wave of democratization that had started to roll across the globe in the 1980s Elections were duly held but their winners proceeded to oppress minorities or attack independent judges and journalists in the name of the people Fareed Zakaria the influential foreign affairs commentator was among the first to draw a fundamental distinction between liberalism and democracy the former referred to the rule of law the latter to the rule of the majority Leaders with majority backing were creating illiberal democracies in which neither political losers nor unpopular minorities could feel safeThis picture is misleading when applied to todays populists like Mr Orban In Hungary it is not just the rule of law that has been under threat Rights essential for democracy itself  especially rights to free speech free assembly and free association  have been systematically attacked As media pluralism disappears citizens cannot get critical information to make up their minds about their governments record Unless one wants to say that a democracy remains a democracy as long as the government does not stuff the ballot boxes on Election Day it is crucial to insist that democracy itself is being damagedUnless this point is understood Mr Orban will continue the perfidious game he likes to play with international critics in particular He does not mind being called illiberal he relishes it For liberalism is supposedly just a matter of subjective value choices Liberals he and his defenders will say simply do not like his conservative family policies his defense of strong nationstates inside the European Union and most of all his complete rejection of immigration Of course one can legitimately disagree about these issues in a democracy But by focusing all attention on them Mr Orban has remade what should be a debate about democratic institutions into yet another culture war This is a strategy Trumpists are also discovering Once the conflict has been declared a matter of subjective values it becomes easy to accuse the liberals of being the real illiberals Even though they are supposed to be the defenders of diversity they cannot tolerate an ethnic nationalist like Mr Orban who seeks to deviate from a supposed Western mainstream of multiculturalismA number of observers are even willing to concede that illiberal democracy might be a somewhat legitimate reaction to undemocratic liberalism The European Union appears as an obvious instance of a liberal technocracy against which the will of the people needs to be asserted But the European Union prescribes neither a uniform legislative stance on controversial questions like samesex marriage nor a single model of democracy Its members just have to be democratic enoughWhen European Union leaders have criticized Hungary and more recently Poland those countries governments have countered that they are defending national sovereignty against liberal diktats from Brussels The Union has played into their hands by suggesting that it is only concerned about the liberal rule of law The European Union thus gives the impression that democracy will always be taken care of by the nationstate and the technocratic liberal repair crew from Brussels only makes a call in a European capital if there is a malfunction with the rule of law hence the undermining of political rights and independent institutions appears like a technical glitch not as the conscious authoritarian project it actually isThe notion of illiberal democracy has also made it easier for European elites to claim that the people themselves have unfortunately turned out to be illiberal and brought these authoritarian governments on themselves Eastern Europeans we are often told are culturally different  code for thinking that they lag behind Western liberal enlightenment But the citizens who brought Mr Orban and the current Polish government to power actually did exactly what democratic theory would have counseled them to do In twoparty systems they threw out the one major party that had a poor record and instead voted for politicians who in both cases presented themselves as moderate mainstream conservatives The latter never revealed  or won an electoral mandate for  their real agenda of perpetuating themselves in power by attacking the institutions that underpin democracyIs all this just a matter of words Thinkers like George Orwell and Hannah Arendt never tired of warning that the political catastrophes of the 20th century began with euphemisms and imprecise language A democracy can have illiberal policies but it cannot do without basic political liberties and protections We are doing Mr Orban a great favor by accepting him as any kind of democrat The designation democracy still remains the most coveted political prize around the world In what can only be called an unforced error we are giving that prize to leaders who not only devalue it but are also busy destroying the thing itselfThis election is probably the last before Hungary shifts from what is already a deeply damaged democracy to what political scientists would call a fullblown electoral autocracy Elections would still be held in the future but a real turnover of power would be impossible Thus the weekends ballot is also a test as to whether there can be an autocracy inside the European Union a selfdeclared club of democraciesJanWerner Mller is a professor of politics at Princeton University and the author of Contesting Democracy Political Ideas in

visitors to sit in his corner of the restaurant the smell of grease meandering through the upstairs eatery where Axl Rose was screaming at me from a jukebox All this while vendors downstairs sold Tshirts with the image of the late singer Juan Gabriel emblazoned across the chest while others negotiated with visitors over the price of a homemade poncho featuring the logo of the Dallas CowboysThe images of daylong excursions to Ciudad Jurez with my father as a child made their way into my memory where they collided with the flashbacks of a teenage me sharing buckets of beers with friends who were convinced that going south of the border for a day was more important than sitting through biologyI was one of tens of thousands to cross into Mexico from El Paso that week challenging the notion that lawlessness in Mexican border cities keeps Americans at bay but gone are the days of oral declarations a passport is now required to reenter the United States as the federal government continues to beef up border enforcementEven in tougher times many of us never stopped coming here It is because there are thousands of El Pasoans like me whose ties that bind them to Ciudad Jurez are familial or economic or both The effects reverberate well north of the Rio Grande Texas is Mexicos No 1 trade partner and the El Paso customs district saw 855 billion in twoway trade with Mexico from January to November 2017 That is the secondhighest total in the United States behind Laredos 270 billionBoth are open to the public and are just two of the museums and tourist attractions city officials and street vendors hope will lure visitors back to a city considered by lawmakers and human rights groups as one of the worlds most dangerous just six years agoPhotographs of Mexican revolutionary figures like Francisco Madero Venustiano Carranza and Francisco Pancho Villa in different areas of revolutionary Jurez highlight the importance of the city during the war There is also an emphasis on how the Americans were responsible for some of the mayhem Such is the case with the exhibition dedicated to Gen John J Pershing who led his socalled Punitive Expedition in pursuit of Villa after the Mexican rebel leader led his forces into Columbus NMAnd although the writers John Reed and Ambrose Bierce are perhaps the most widely known Americans who were fascinated enough by the war in Mexico to become a part of it the MUREF instead dedicates space to local photographers and writers like Melville Jean Herskovits Harvey Kiefer and Esther Eva Strauss whose curiosity and dedication to photojournalism helped document the war for readers in Texas and beyondAfter leaving the museum and walking back toward downtowns Paso Del Norte bridge I realized there remains a sense of adventure associated with going into Ciudad Jurez which I assume could still be slightly overwhelming for new visitors Though violence has decreased significantly the sight of a federal police truck carrying masked soldiers clutching semiautomatic rifles can still be somewhat jarring to visitors who are not accustomed to itI spotted two of these conducting routine patrols before my last stop on this day trip the Kentucky Club The bar has been in business since the 1920s and was frequented by Americans in need of a beer whiskey or tequila during Prohibition It has retained its reputation as a laidback place for patrons on both sides of the Rio Grande and was one of the few pubs that didnt shut its doors during the drug cartel wars that raged in the city from 2008 to 2011 You can stay here for a beer or two or one of their famous margaritas or spend hours on end reading about its famous patrons and watching the flatscreen televisions above the handcarved wooden bar As the evening wears on available seats are fewer and the music louderFarther away from the cathedral and the museums Ciudad Jurez offers up more for visitors willing to take a cab Uber or drive themselves into the cityVilla del Mar was a family favorite growing up The owners opened a branch in El Paso after the drug violence began but the original location is still up and running in Ciudad JurezThis was my first time at Los Arcos recommended by a family friend A delectable dish of baconwrapped stuffed shrimp a beer and a bottle of water was less than 350 pesos or about 19Much of El Pasos identity is rooted in its remoteness It is in a different time zone than most of Texas It is closer to the capitals of three other states  Arizona New Mexico and Chihuahua  than it is to Austin It is surrounded by mountains and desert that offer few clear distinctions as to where the city in Texas ends and the one in Mexico beginsI was born and raised here My moms house is in the Austin Terrace neighborhood and my fathers house was two blocks from the eastern foothills of the Franklin Mountains in a part of the city that used to be called Chivas Town so named because it was where goat farmers lived before the neighborhood was incorporated by the cityAfter moving away for school and work for a number of years I realized I had not taken advantage of what the Franklin Mountains had to offer So when I came back I set out to explore the hiking trails and mountain peaks my friends brag about on social media during their bike rides and other excursionsThe base one of the largest in the country is home to the First Armored Division of the United States Army and spreads across Texas and New Mexico on more than a million acres of federally owned land Its history is on view at the Old Ironsides Museum on the base which features exhibits about the history of the base and the division and rationing efforts by Americans during World War II A plaque next to an Abrams M1 tank honors Sgt Israel Devora Garcia who was born in Zacatecas Mexico and raised in nearby Clint Tex He died in combat operations in Iraq in 2006 Admission to the museum is free Visitors must get a pass to the base before entering its easy but can be timeconsuming on weekendsFort Bliss is one reason so many El Pasoans are so patriotic one of the citys main highways Route 54 was designated the Patriot Freeway during the first Gulf WarIn addition to mountains desert sunsets and the legend of Pancho Villa residents of both Ciudad Jurez and El Paso have something the rest of the other cities along the Rio Grande dont New MexicoBecause it is on the

Amendment advocates How could a bunch of teenagers have the wherewithal to make change in Americas deadlocked politics After all theyre just kidsOlder people have long grumbled about the young in politics dismissing them as baby politicians or beardless boys in the early years of this country But when American politics were at their darkest in the late 19th century it was young people who broke a partisan divide and helped save democracy Maybe they can do it againDemocracy as a rule has a labor problem Someone has to do the hard unpaid work of persuading millions of citizens to participate For much of our history enthusiastic young people did that labor for free Even today visit any campaign headquarters and you will find a sea of youthful volunteers phonebanking and postermaking But while young people have long done an outsize portion of the political work they were rarely allowed to pick the issues politics addressedIt was only when adult politicians seemed stalled and issueless that a generation of young people stepped up to leadFor much of the first century of American politics young people operated as unpaid foot soldiers of partisan political armies In a popular loud dirty system there was plenty of unglamorous work to be done For every enormous rally or rowdy election there were people still too young to vote working behind the scenes handing out ballots and emptying spittoons toasting allies speeches and cracking rivals skullsThe one thing young people were not supposed to do for much of the 1800s was to champion themselves They were referred to as generous and unsophisticated  worker bees to be directed by the older and wiser As one 16yearold antislavery activist in Maine complained when he tried to talk politics with voters many laughed at his childish enthusiasm and coolly reminded me that I was a boyEven among youthful activists many felt conflicted about whether they should originate opinions or merely carry them out Young men and women were raised to revere their democracy did they really have a right to guide it yet During an 1831 rally against what they called the slimy mark President Andrew Jackson was leaving on the country young men in Baltimore nonetheless worried that they were overstepping the modesty which befits our ageThis was an age that could not afford to put down the young Over the second half of the 1800s American politics darkened The succession of Civil War Reconstruction and the Gilded Age was marked by bitter partisanship endemic corruption appalling violence and a general sense that democracy was failing Adults seemed to be stuck recycling the same partisan issues over and overAnd they insisted that the young follow their lead As an established Minnesota politico told one rising 25yearold Dont think just follow the partys platform just swallow it downBut in the final years of the 19th century a sudden burst of young people demanded new issues  their issues Tired of as one Coloradan put it rotten old hulks who monopolize the offices and dwell upon the past a generation of young men and women denounced their leaders and with them partisanship They demanded political reform labor reform and social reform and declared that they would withhold their votes from any party that didnt respond The ratio of party feeling and selfinterest is rapidly changing declared one sharptongued New Yorker in 1898 adding that the younger generation hates both parties equallyPoliticians saw the change and chased after those young voters Soon The Washington Post was begging Dont sneer at them as boys when they drop into your ward meetings dont make them do all the work of the campaignIn the new century young peoples self interest helped kill extreme polarization by forcing both parties to pursue the same set of demands Youthful independent voters emerged as a decisive third force with just enough influence to swing close elections Politicians scrambled after them beginning the Progressive Era passing laws protecting workers cleaning up cities and championing the youngWomen played a key role in this shift Because they could not vote they were less corrupted by partisanship Women in their 20s worked to refocus American public life toward social concerns They built schools  nearly one a day between 1890 and 1920  and fought child labor The aggressive crusader Florence Kelley wrote that protecting young people is the noblest duty of the Republic an act of self preservation that enables the next generation to champion itselfThis is the key to understanding youth politics Young people cannot be truly selfish because they cannot be permanently young Youth is temporary its gains are passed on In the late 19th century young people built institutions that helped protect 20thcentury young people The high school seniors marching over the weekend will hopefully make their schools safer well after they have graduated If anyone should be choosing the issues

hedged in with historic stone houses and walls As commuter traffic has intensified over the past several years its become increasingly dangerous to walk along Main StreetThe mayor of my tiny Virginia town has worked incessantly to fix this by fostering walkability and trafficcalming measures since he ran for town council in the 1990s Im determined to help him I want to walk with my daughter to the playground or the farmers market without fearing for her safetyOur mayor is liberal He drives around town with an Obama 08 bumper sticker on his car I am a conservative prolife Christian in 2016 I voted for Evan McMullin for president But our partisan political differences mean nothing when it comes to caring for this town and making it better Here at the local level our interests intertwine They are practical achievable even apoliticalThis is localism a bottomup practically oriented way of looking at todays biggest policy dilemmas Instead of always or only seeking to fix municipal issues through national policy localism suggests that communities can and should find solutions to their own particular problems within their own particular contexts The best walkability solutions for Washington DC may not work in my town Urban revitalization efforts in Detroit will need to look different than those efforts employed in rural IowaIf were to find hope and unity for our politics in this fractured era localism may be the perfect place to startWhen you arrogate a fight to the national level the stakes are much higher than necessary Mr Salatin told me At the state or local level the stakes are not nearly as high because the numbers are smaller the ability to change is easier and policies can be customized to specific geopolitical contextsWhen I go talk at the local level when people come in at the start they bring their leftright paradigm with them Mr Marohn said But as soon as we have this conversation about strong towns making things local and making government functional things make sense People no longer use left and right talking pointsLocalism often manifests itself in localscale economic measures or laws Mr Marohn has found that many of the most helpful infrastructure fixes for impoverished towns and cities are small low budget and gradual  such as doing street maintenance planting trees building crosswalks and cleaning up parksBut localism can also display itself in greater elasticity among private philanthropy public policy and the financial sector As Mr Katz and Mr Nowak document in their book private businesses and philanthropies have worked alongside city governments to achieve important reforms in places like Indianapolis Pittsburgh and Chattanooga TennA deeper challenge to localism as fewer Americans get their news from the local press is the warlike rhetoric that dominates our national news cycle We are more likely to know about Mr Trumps latest tweet than we are about the latest town meetingIf citizens turn off cable news and instead step outside their front doors seeking to care for their communities they may help fight back some of the anger that has fractured our politics For those who volunteer together at a local soup kitchen homeless shelter Rotary Club or Boy Scout troop national battles matter much less than local tangible needsRediscovering our communal identities will require unplugging from our devices and returning to the local institutions that used to facilitate a center like school boards church soup kitchens town hall meetings and libraries Disappearing bipartisanship may be rediscovered as the journalist Sarah Smarsh puts it in direct communion sharing a missionLocalism is not a perfect cure for national division and cannot serve as a full replacement for national politics in a globalized era But at a time in which many Americans feel disenfranchised disillusioned and defenseless its empowerment may act as a sort of balmGrowing up poor in rural Kansas in the 1980s Ms Smarsh remembers her grandparents constantly extending help to their neighbors Just about every day some widowed farmer showed up for dinner or a stranger needed help with his car down the road or a stray dog limped up the driveway she recalls Grandma put more potatoes in the skillet Grandpa got his wrench I made a warm spot in the barn for the dog to eat and healIn those early years Ms Smarsh learned that stewardship must start at home if its to be real and authentic Those who ignore the homeless on their city streets instead donating money to global causes from behind their laptops are ignoring local wholeness in their pursuit of international wellbeing And while the latter is important it should never come at the cost of the formerSince moving to this tiny Virginia town Ive seen our mayor work for walkability better broadband service and cleaner water I have seen him walk the streets early and late visiting local businesses and talking to homeowners No matter our political dissimilarities he is exemplifying the sort of local activism I aspire to in my own life So even if there is plenty that could divide us I am going to focus on what unites us this town Considering the deep rancor of our national politics that gives me hope for the futureGracy Olmstead has written for The American Conservative The Week National Review The Weekly Standard and The Washington Post and other

stretching all the way back to when Manhattans own Alexander Hamilton fixed his sights on backwoods whiskey distilleries as a revenue source for the new Republic prompting rebellion But one could make the case that the divide has never consumed us as much as it does today The political parties are aligned more than ever around blue metropolises and red spaces in between Economic growth is now so glaringly concentrated in certain urban areas that it has reignited the ageold debate over staying vs going Should the young and ambitious from struggling small towns and cities be encouraged to seek their fortune in the hotbeds of dynamism and overpriced Sunday brunch or does this only sunder family ties and hasten the collapse of the interiorThe extremity of Westovers upbringing emerges gradually through her telling which only makes the telling more alluring and harrowing The basics are these Now in her early 30s she was the youngest of seven in a survivalist family in the shadow of a mountain in a Mormon pocket of southeastern Idaho Her father Gene a pseudonym grew up on a farm at the base of the mountain the son of a hottempered father and moved up the slope with his wife the product of a more genteel upbringing in the nearby small town Gene sustained his growing family by building barns and hay sheds and by scrapping metal in his junkyard his wife Faye also a pseudonym chipped in with her income from mixing up herbal remedies and from her reluctant work as an unlicensed midwifes assistant and then midwifeDuring his 20s Genes edgy and not uncharismatic intensity morphed into politically charged paranoia fueled by what the reader is led to presume is a severe case of bipolar disorder Around the age of 30 he pulled his eldest children from school to protect them from the Illuminati though they at least had the benefit of a birth certificate an indulgence the youngest four would be denied In theory the children were being homeschooled in reality there was virtually no academic instruction to speak of They learned to read from the Bible the Book of Mormon and the speeches of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young The only science book in the house was for young children full of glossy illustrations The bulk of their time was spent helping their parents at work Barely into her teens Westover graduated from helping her mom mix remedies and birth babies to sorting scrap with her dad who had the unnerving habit of inadvertently hitting her with pieces hed tossedGetting hit with a steel cylinder square in the gut was the least of the risks in the Westover household The book is among other things a catalog of jobsite horrors fingers lost legs gashed bodies horribly burned No pointyheaded bureaucrat could make a stronger case for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration than do the unregulated Westovers with their many calamities Making matters worse is Genes refusal to allow any of the injured and wounded himself included to seek medical attention beyond his wifes tinctures  Gods pharmacy  a refusal that also greatly exacerbates the effects of two terrible car accidents God and his angels are here working right alongside us he tells Westover They wont let you get hurt When she gets tonsillitis he tells her to stand outside with her mouth open so that the sun can work its magic She does for a monthAs time goes on the conflict between father and daughter gathers as inevitably as the lengthening fall shadows from Bucks Peak above Genes fervor and paranoia are undiminished by the failure of the world to end at Y2K despite his ample preparations Westover offers the pathosfilled image of her father sitting expressionless in front of The Honeymooners as the world ticks quietly onward Meanwhile she is starting to test the boundaries of an upbringing more tightly constricted than she can even begin to imagine Her venture into a local dance class ends with her father condemning the groups painfully modest performance outfits as whorish Encouraged by an older brother who started studying covertly and eventually left for college Westover attempts to do likewise reading deep into her fathers books on the 19thcentury Mormon prophets The skill I was learning was a crucial one the patience to read things I could not yet understand she writes with characteristic understatement Only very occasionally is Westovers assured prose marred by unnecessary curlicues As if her fathers tyranny is not enough she must contend also with sadistic physical attacks from a different brother whose instability was worsened by a 12foot headfirst plunge onto rebar in yet another Westover workplace accidentTara makes her first big step toward liberation by remarkably doing well enough on the ACT to gain admission to Brigham Young University It proves one thing at least her father says grudgingly Our home school is as good as any public education There she is shocked by the profane habits of her classmates like the roommate who wears pink plush pajamas with Juicy emblazoned on the rear and in turn shocks her classmates with her ignorance never more so than when she asks blithely in art history class what the Holocaust was Other new discoveries for her Napoleon Martin Luther King Jr the fact that Europe is not a country Such excruciating moments do not keep professors from recognizing her talent and voracious hunger to learn soon enough shes off to a fellowship at Cambridge University where a renowned professor  a Holocaust expert no less  cant help exclaiming when he meets her How marvelous Its as if Ive stepped into Shaws PygmalionWestover eventually makes it to Harvard for another fellowship and then back to Cambridge to pursue her PhD in history Even then shes not yet fully sprung so deeply rooted are the tangled familial claims of loyalty guilt shame and yes love It is only when the final wrenching break from most of her family arrives that one realizes just how courageous this testimonial really is These disclosures will take a toll But one is also left convinced that the costs are worth it By the end Westover has somehow managed not only to capture her unsurpassably exceptional upbringing but to make her current situation seem not so exceptional at all and resonant for many others She is but yet another young person who left home for an education now views the family she left across an uncomprehending ideological canyon and isnt going backAlec MacGillis covers government and politics for ProPublica He is the author of The Cynic The Political Education of

secrets Shes free to grow out her hair travel the world and spend time with whomever she likesBut a year since former President Barack Obama commuted Mannings 35year sentence Americas most famous convicted leaker isnt taking an extended vacation Far from it The Oklahoma native has decided to make an unlikely bid for the US Senate in her adopted state of MarylandManning 30 filed to run in January and has been registered to vote in Maryland since August She lives in North Bethesda not far from where she stayed with an aunt while awaiting trial Her aim is to unseat Sen Ben Cardin a 74yearold Maryland Democrat who is seeking his third Senate term and previously served 10 terms in the US HouseManning who also has become an internationally recognized transgender activist said shes motivated by a desire to fight what she sees as a shadowy surveillance state and a rising tide of nightmarish repressionThe rise of authoritarianism is encroaching in every aspect of life whether its government or corporate or technological Manning told The Associated Press during an interview at her home in an upscale apartment tower On the walls of her barely furnished living room hang Obamas commutation order and photos of US anarchist Emma Goldman and British playwright Oscar WildeMannings longshot campaign for the June 26 primary would appear to be one of the more unorthodox US Senate bids in recent memory and the candidate is operating well outside the partys playbook She says she doesnt in fact even consider herself a Democrat but is motivated by a desire to shake up establishment Democrats who are caving in to President Donald Trumps administration She vows she wont run as an independent if her primary bid failsShes certainly got an eyecatching platform Close prisons and free inmates eliminate national borders restructure the criminal justice system provide universal health care and basic income The top of her agenda Abolish the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement a federal agency created in 2003 that Manning asserts is preparing for an ethnic cleansingManning ticks off life experiences she believes would make her an effective senator a stint being homeless in Chicago her wartime experiences as a US Army intelligence analyst in Iraq  even her seven years in prison She asserts shes got a bigger vision than establishment politiciansBut political analysts suspect the convicted felon is not running to winManning is running as a protest candidate which has a long lineage in American history to shine light on American empire said Daniel Schlozman a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University Thats a very different goal with a very different campaign than if she wanted to beat Ben CardinMannings insurgent candidacy thus far has been a decidedly strippeddown affair with few appearances and a campaign website that just went up In recent days she approached an antifracking rally in Baltimore almost furtively keeping to herself for much of the demonstration But when it was her turn to address the small group her celebrity status was evident People who never met her called her by her first name and eagerly took photosManning has acknowledged leaking more than 700000 military and State Department documents to antisecrecy site WikiLeaks in 2010 She said her motivation was a desire to spark debate about US foreign policy and she has been portrayed as both a hero and a traitorKnown as Bradley Manning at the time of her arrest she came out as transgender after her 2013 courtmartial She was barred from growing her hair long in prison and was approved for hormone therapy only after litigation She spent long stints in solitary confinement and twice tried to kill herselfThe Pentagon which has repeatedly declined to discuss Mannings treatment in military prison is also staying mum about her political ambitions Democratic Party officials say they have no comment citing a policy not to weigh in on primaries Republican operatives are quietIn Maryland a blue state thats home to tens of thousands of federal employees and defense contractors it appears Mannings main supporters are independents or antipolitics making them unlikely to coalesce politically She recently reported contributions of 72000 on this years first quarterly finance statement compared with Cardins 336000The candidate has barely made an effort at tapping sources of grassroots enthusiasm outside of activism circles And its easy to find Democrats who feel her candidacy is just a vehicle to boost her profileIt feels to me almost like its part of a book tour  that this is her moment after being released from prison said Dana Beyer a transgender woman who leads the Gender Rights Maryland nonprofit and is a Democratic candidate for state senate I dont think this is a serious effortManning is indeed working on a book about her dramatic life For now she says she supports herself with income from speaking engagements Shes spoken at various US colleges and is due to take the stage at a Montreal conference later this monthLast week she appeared at a tech conference in Germanys capital of Berlin arriving to cheers from the audience of several thousand people She told attendees shes still struggling to adjust to life after prison and hasnt gotten used to her celebrity status yetTheres been a kind of cult of personality that is really intimidating and that is overwhelming for me she said in BerlinAt her Maryland apartment Manning told the AP she occasionally wakes up panicked that shes back in the cage in Kuwait where she was first jailed or incarcerated at the Marine base at Quantico Virginia where a UN official concluded shed been subjected to cruel inhuman and degrading treatment She works hard to overcome anxiety centering herself with yoga breathing exercises and readingIve been out for almost a year now and its becoming increasingly clear to me just how deep the wounds are she said in her Spartan living

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to ban members of Parliament from having sex with their subordinates  the first time in five years that the rules on ministerial conduct had been updatedBut according to women who work in the halls of Australian power the scandals in February were but a tiny sampling of the pervasive culture of sexual harassment endemic to the countrys politicsIt was clear that a bully boy culture had accumulated over many many years said Ellen Sandell a Greens politician and member of the Victorian State Parliament Its got to start somewhereThat culture of harassment and protection for powerful men women say has prevented more accusers from speaking publicly about encounters with politicians It has also they say stymied a more robust MeToo movement  akin to those that have rattled Washington and Hollywood  from taking holdI know it prevented a number of other victims and witnesses feeling safe to come forward said Tessa Sullivan a former Melbourne City Council member who accused Mr Doyle of harassment A number of politicians knew about my abuse and tried to deter me from speaking outAustralias universities are in the early phases of a reckoningOver the past few years students at the University of Sydney Australian National University and on several other campuses have mobilized against rape culture drawing attention to a lack of punishment for sexual assault and harassmentHow are public institutions in Australia responding to sexual assault and sexual harassment To inform our coverage were asking readers to contribute their storiesMany Australian women a generation removed said it was at least as bad or worse during their student days And they said the culture of student politics did not helpEach of Australias main political parties has an active youth wing  the Young Liberals promote themselves to anyone ages 16 to 31 Young Labor focuses on anyone under 26  and their efforts often overlap with oncampus campaignsMany lawmakers started out in this milieu with student bodies or union boards before moving to staffing roles party offices or legislatures Three of Australias five most recent prime ministers  Malcolm Turnbull Tony Abbott

many political workplaces can produce situations where professional and personal boundaries are poorly definedMr Joyce the deputy prime minister ended up having an extramarital affair with a younger member of his staff  thats the extreme But there are other problems with combining power proximity and desireCloseness can sometimes be misread especially if alcohols involved Ms Munro said People can be inappropriately handsy and sometimes get away with things because its considered a bit too difficult to manage in a longterm sense You just sort of address it quietlyMs Sullivan the former Melbourne council member whose allegation helped topple the citys mayor he denies the accusation said women working in Australian politics frequently warn one another privately about male colleagues
